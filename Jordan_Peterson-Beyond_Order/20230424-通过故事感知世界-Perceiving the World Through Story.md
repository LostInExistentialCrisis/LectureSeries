## 通过故事感知世界

Perceiving the World Through Story

### 开场白&近期计划

谢谢大家今晚的到来。我想和大家聊聊这套西装。前阵子，有一家公司联系了我，叫LGFG。这套西装里面有像罗素·布兰德、乔·罗根、本·夏皮罗、萨姆·哈里斯和布雷特·温斯坦这样的人的照片。这挺有趣的。我27号会去见乔，我有一个重要的公告要发布，大家可以听听看有没有兴趣。

Thank you for coming tonight. I'm going to tell you about this suit. So I had this company reach out to me a while back, LGFG. Inside this suit are pictures of people like Russell Brand, Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, Sam Harris, and Brett Weinstein. That's pretty funny. I'm going to see Joe on the 27th. Yeah, I have a major announcement for the 27th, so you guys can listen in and see if you're interested.

我想告诉大家一些正在进行的事情。我会先说一件。我们发布了几则广告，一个是为这款写作应用程序，另一个是为彼得森学院。这两个项目进展都很顺利。我认为这款写作应用程序现在有大量的订阅者和用户，我们真的希望能教会一百万人如何写作。你需要学会写作，因为写作就是思考，而思考能让你避免陷入困境。

So I want to tell you a couple of things that are going on. I'll just tell you one of them. We ran a couple of ads, I suppose they are for this essay app and for Peterson Academy. Both those are coming along nicely. That essay app, I think we have a large number of subscribers and users now, and we're really hoping that we can teach like a million people how to write. You need to know how to write because writing is thinking, and thinking stops you from falling into a pit.

你需要思考。你需要思考，以便你的想法可以死去，而不是你自己。这就是思考的实用定义。至于彼得森学院，我准备了很多精彩的讲座，追求这个事业让我感到非常振奋，因为我有机会结识世界各地的杰出人物。能在我的播客中采访他们是巨大的荣幸，我能够亲眼见证谁在沟通方面特别出色，谁真的有话要说。

So you need to think. You need to think so that your ideas can die instead of you. That's the definition of the utility of thinking. And then with this Peterson Academy, I've got a lot of great lectures lined up, and it's been very heartening to pursue this enterprise because I've been able to meet remarkable people all over the world. It's an immense privilege to interview many of them on my podcast, and I've been able to see firsthand who is extraordinarily good at communicating and who really has something to say.

所有被我邀请来为彼得森学院讲课的人都同意了。

All the people that I've invited to come and lecture for this Peterson Academy have agreed to do so.

我们希望能实现这一点。去年，我和女儿以及家人在迈阿密买了一间工作室。这是一家旧的招牌绘画工厂，经过了翻新。现在，我们在现场观众面前录制了一系列四个两小时的讲座。我们希望能将学士学位的费用降至4000美元，减少95%。我认为这是非常了不起的事情。我认为这是可能的，虽然还有一些障碍需要克服。我们还没有解决认证问题，因为要提供真正的大学学分，必须经过正式的认证过程。但在这方面我们已经有了一些进展，计划在11月正式启动。我认为我们能解决认证问题。

And so we're hoping that we can do this, my daughter and I and my family bought a studio in Miami last year. It was an old sign painting factory that has been revamped. Now, we're recording a series of four two-hour lectures in front of live audiences. We're hoping that we can drive the cost of a bachelor's degree down to $4,000 — a 95% reduction. I think that would be quite remarkable. I think it's possible, though there are still some hoops to jump through. We haven't cracked the accreditation problem yet because to offer true university credit, you have to undergo a formal accreditation process. But we've got irons in the fire on that front, and it looks like we're definitely going to launch it in November. That's the plan, and I think we can crack the accreditation problem.

我还有一些关于讲课人的秘密计划，今晚不会谈到，但最终会公开。所以，这非常令人兴奋。

I've got some other devious plans underway regarding who's going to lecture. I won't talk about that tonight, but eventually. So, that's pretty exciting.

我们刚刚录制了乔纳森·帕乔的讲座，他主持一个叫“符号世界”的播客。如果你觉得我讨论的话题有意义且引人入胜，乔纳森·帕乔非常值得一听。他是我见过的最深刻的宗教思想家，同时也非常精通后现代理论，此外，他还是一名东正教基督教图标雕刻家。因此，他真的是一个非常独特的人。他刚刚为我们录制了一系列讲座，我们有很棒的讲师，所以我们对此非常兴奋。我们还计划推出一个相当于学费的订阅服务。我们希望将发展中国家的人与发达国家的学生一对一配对，这样如果西方有人支付订阅费用并注册大学，他们可以与发展中国家的人结成联盟，使那些本来负担不起大学费用的人也能成为学生，并建立个人关系。

We just taped Jonathan Pajo, who runs a podcast called This Symbolic World. If you find the topics I discuss meaningful and engaging, Jonathan Pagio is very much worth checking out. He's the deepest religious thinker I've ever met and very well versed in postmodern theory as well, he's also an orthodox Christian icon carver. And so he's a very singular sort of person. He just did a series of lectures for us, and we have great lecturers, so we're very excited about that. We're also planning a subscription service that'll be equivalent to the tuition. We want to match people in the developing world one-on-one with students in the developed world, so that if someone in the West pays for a subscription and enrolls in the university, they can ally themselves with someone in the developing world who would also be able to be a student and form a personal relationship, hopefully, but also welcome people who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford to go to university.

如果我们能实现这一点，那将非常酷。我刚刚去了一趟……是的，如果能实现那将是非常棒的，对吧？

So, that would be cool if we could pull it off. I was just down in... yeah, it would be great if it could happen, you know?

所以，我看不出为什么不能。大学不仅仅是讲座、考试和认证。你不能完全在线复制整个体验。我认为人们愿意支付十五万美元获取本科学位的部分原因是你可以在大学找到你的妻子或丈夫。这不是小事；这是一个巨大的机会。大学的社交元素非常重要；你会结交新朋友并建立社交网络。大学有很多不属于正规教育的功能。它给了你一个离开家的机会，是从青春期晚期到完全成年之间的过渡期。它让你有机会整理自己，当然，希望还能学到一些东西，尽管我们似乎已经基本上忽略了整个过程中的这一部分。

So, and I can't see why not. Universities are more than lectures, examinations, and accreditation. It's not like you can duplicate the whole experience online. I think part of the reason that people are willing to pay, say, a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to get an undergraduate degree is because you can go to a university and find your wife or husband. That's not nothing; that's a huge opportunity. The social element of university is significant; you get a new peer group and make a social network. There's a lot university does that's not associated with formal education. It gives you a chance to move away from home, an intermediary time between late adolescence and full adulthood. It allows you to sort yourself out a little bit and, hopefully, actually learn something, although we seem to have pretty much dispensed with that part of the whole process.

要复制所有这些确实很难，但我们至少应该能够复制相当一部分。这真的很令人兴奋。我还刚刚在迈阿密待了两周。大约六个月前，我和八位学者一起去了那里。Daily Wire Plus帮助安排了这一切。在我的旅行中，我找到了很多我认为在叙事、故事，特别是圣经故事方面有深刻见解且易于理解的人。在Daily Wire Plus团队的帮助下，我再次将他们带到迈阿密，进行了一次关于出埃及记的研讨会。出埃及记是一个伟大的故事，非常非常深刻。我对这个故事非常熟悉，但还没有达到我想要的那种透彻理解。

It's going to be hard to duplicate all of that, but we should be able to duplicate a fair bit of it anyway. That's really exciting. Now, I was also just down in Miami over the last two weeks. About six months ago, I went down there with a group of eight scholars. The Daily Wire Plus helped arrange this. I found a number of people in my travels who I thought had something to say that was deep and also accessible about narrative, about story, and specifically about biblical stories but more broadly about stories in general. I brought them together in Miami again with the help of the Daily Wire Plus crew to undertake a seminar on Exodus. Exodus is a great story, a very, very deep story. I knew the story pretty well but not as thoroughly as I wanted to.

2017年，我做了一系列关于《创世纪》的讲座，大家可能熟悉。这些讲座在宗教群体中相当受欢迎——基督徒、犹太人和穆斯林都喜欢，甚至无神论者也感兴趣。我想继续这个系列。我原计划去剑桥大学做一个关于《出埃及记》的研讨会，我受到了正式邀请，但后来邀请被撤销了。剑桥的教授们在幕后斗争了三年，推翻了那些最初取消我邀请的觉醒意识形态的专制散布流言者。他们成功了，也许他们会改变英国的法律，使这种取消邀请的行为在英国大学不再可能。

In 2017, I did a series of lectures on Genesis, which some of you may be familiar with. They turned out to be relatively popular among religious types—Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike—but also among atheists, interestingly enough. I wanted to continue that. I had planned to go to Cambridge and do a seminar there on Exodus. I was invited to Cambridge to do that, formally invited, and then the invitation was rescinded. Professors at Cambridge fought for three years behind the scenes to overthrow the woke, ideologue, tyrant gossipers that canceled me to begin with. They managed that, and maybe they're going to change the law in the UK altogether to make that kind of disinvitation no longer possible at UK universities.

这种新法律源自剑桥大学的幕后策略，现在已经在英国议会系统中几乎完成了。大约六个月内，成为英国法律的可能性相当高。

That new law, which emerged out of the behind-the-scenes strategizing at Cambridge University, has just about made its way through the UK parliamentary system now. It's reasonably probable that that'll be UK law within six months or so.

这真的是个好消息。不管怎样，我没能去剑桥做研讨会，所以我决定私下举办，邀请这八个人来到迈阿密，共同探索《出埃及记》的故事。去年七月，我们在那里进行了大约六次会面，约十二小时，才意识到只能完成一半。所以我问Daily Wire的人能否延长拍摄时间，他们立刻同意了，非常慷慨。我们上周再次聚在一起完成了剩下的内容。我们又进行了九次会面，本·夏皮罗加入了我们，这很好，因为他的智力如同机关枪般迅速，对旧约非常熟悉。我们有一支出色的团队。

So that's a really good deal. In any case, I couldn't go to Cambridge to do the seminar, so I decided to host it privately and invited these eight people down to Miami to undertake a journey through the Exodus story. We got down there last July, I think, and had about six sessions, around 12 hours, and realized that we were only going to get halfway through. So I asked the Daily Wire people if they would double the filming time, and they immediately agreed, which was very generous of them. We got together a week ago and finished it off. We did nine more sessions, and Ben Shapiro joined us, which was great because he has a machine gun intellect and very deep knowledge of the Old Testament. We had a stellar crew together.

我认为最后九次会面比前八次更好，而前八次是Daily Wire制作的最受欢迎的系列。他们有一百万订阅者，其中六十万人观看了这个系列。而且，这也是我告诉你们的原因，Daily Wire将在未来几个月内将整个研讨会在YouTube上免费发布。真的很感谢他们，也将在Daily Wire Plus平台上免费提供。我们会每周发布一集，共17周，然后会保留大约四个月。希望大家都能观看。我也计划在今年秋天晚些时候进行个人讲座系列，这也应该可以在线上观看。所以这就是即将发生的事情，前提是世界在那之前不会崩溃。我们看看接下来几个月俄罗斯会如何处理他们的事务。

I think the last nine sessions were better than the first eight, and the first eight were the most popular series that the Daily Wire produced. They have a million subscribers, and 600,000 of their subscribers watched the series. Additionally, and this is actually why I'm telling you this, the Daily Wire is going to release the whole seminar on YouTube starting in the next couple of months for everyone to watch for free. It's really good of them, and it will be freely available on the Daily Wire Plus platform too. We'll release one a week for 17 weeks and then leave it up for about four months. Hopefully, everybody can watch that. I'm also going to do a personal lecture series on Exodus, probably later this fall, which should be accessible online. So that's all coming down the pipeline, assuming the world doesn't fall apart before that happens. We'll see how the Russians manage their affairs over the next few months on that front.

### 视觉：当你看世界时

总之，这些是正在进行中的一些事情。今晚我想和大家聊聊叙事的概念。在过去的几十年，尤其是过去五年里，很明显我们必须通过某种结构来看待世界。正确的思考方式是将其视为注意力优先级的层次结构。为了理解这一点，我先讲一些关于视觉系统的知识，这样你们可以理解它的含义。

In any case, those are some of the things that are in the pipeline. I thought tonight I would talk to you a little bit about the idea of narrative. One of the things that has become quite clear in the last decades, and even more sharply in the last five years, is that we, by necessity, have to see the world through a structure. The proper way of thinking about this structure is as a hierarchy of attentional prioritization. To understand that, I'm going to tell you a little bit about the visual system first so that you can understand what this means.

看世界非常困难。它需要大量的认知资源，大量的脑力和心理生理结构。这需要很多资源和能量。感知世界是一个非常耗能和费力的过程。你的一半大脑直接用于视觉处理，其余大脑也密切参与其中。甚至负责行动的部分大脑也负责感知。详细感知比低分辨率和模糊感知更困难，这在你的眼睛结构中得到了体现。

It's very, very difficult to see the world. It takes an awful lot of cognitive resources, a lot of brain power, and a lot of psychophysiological structure. This takes a lot of resources and energy. Perceiving the world is a very energy-demanding and effortful process. Half your brain is devoted directly to visual processing, and the rest of your brain is integrally involved as well. Even the parts of your brain that are responsible for action are responsible for perception as well. Detailed perception is even more difficult than low-resolution and vague perception, and this is reflected literally in the way that your eyes are structured.

当你看世界时，你的视觉中心点，称为中央凹，是非常高分辨率的。当我看观众时，我可以看清一个人的脸。如果我看某人的脸，我可以看到他们的面部特征并将其识别为个体。但如果我看一个人，即使是他旁边的两个人，只要我不直接看他们，他们就相当模糊。我只能看到他们嘴和眼睛的基本轮廓。当我看五个人之外时，我只能看到模糊的形状，再远一点，基本上什么也看不清。你的视觉从极高分辨率到越来越低分辨率，向外延伸到周边。原因是处理高分辨率中心点需要太多的皮层资源，你的大脑需要像你能想象的最糟糕的外星人那么大，才能看到一个高分辨率的焦点细节。

When you're looking out at the world, the center point of your vision, called the fovea, is set up so that it's extraordinarily high resolution. When I'm looking out at the audience, I can look at one face at a time. If I look at one person's face, I can see their facial features and identify them as an individual. But if I look at a given person, even the two people sitting beside them, as long as I don't glance directly at them, they're quite vague. I can only see the basic outlines of their mouth and their eyes. By the time I'm five people away, I can just see vague shapes, and out here, it's basically nothing. Your vision moves from extremely high resolution to lower and lower resolution as you move out towards the periphery. The reason for that is that it takes so much cortical resource to process the high-resolution center that your brain would have to be the size of the worst alien you could possibly imagine for you to see other than a pinprick of high-resolution focal detail.

你克服这个问题的方法是通过移动进行采样。当你看世界时，你可能会认为自己是被动地看，因为感觉是那样，但实际并非如此。你用眼睛做的事情就像盲人用手做的事情一样。盲人可以通过手视觉化；你用眼睛做同样的事情。没有行动就没有感知，这总是如此。有些是无意识和自动的，但你使用很多自愿决策来决定看哪里。

The way you overcome that problem is by moving to sample when you're looking at the world. You might think you look at the world passively because it sort of feels that way, but that's not exactly right. You do the same thing with your eyes that a blind man might do if he was trying to visualize. Blind people can visualize; they just use their hands to do it. To visualize the speaker, you have to move to sample. You do exactly the same thing with your eyes. There's no perception without action, ever. Some of this is unconscious and automatic, but you use a lot of voluntary decision to determine where to look.

你使用各种线索，因为你要决定将稀缺的感知资源花在哪里。一个你使用的线索是别人的眼睛。当你和别人交谈时，你通常会直接看他们的眼睛。这也使你能够看到他们的整个脸并处理他们的情绪显示和进一步的情绪状态。通过看他们的眼睛，你可以知道他们在看哪里，而你想看别人看的地方，因为别人也在计算你应该看哪里。如果你能知道他们在看哪里，你就知道你应该看哪里。

You use all sorts of cues because you have to decide where you're going to expend scarce resources in perception. One of the cues you use is other people's eyes. When you're talking to someone, you typically look directly at their eyes. This also enables you to take in their whole face and process their emotional display and further emotional state. By looking at their eyes, you can tell where they're looking, and you want to look where other people are looking because other people are also calculating where you should look. If you can tell where they're looking, you know where you should look.

有一个著名的社会心理学实验，你可以自己试试。你只需走到一个繁忙的街角，站在那里抬头看。你这样做时，其他人会停下来抬头看。不久之后，会有八个人站在那里看，然后是五十个人，因为如果八个人在看，那里一定有值得看的东西。

There's a famous social psychology experiment which you can run yourself. All you have to do is go to a busy street, stand on a corner, and look up. As you do that, other people will stop and look up. Soon, there will be eight people standing there looking up, and then 50, because if eight people are looking, there must be something worth looking at. 

人类的眼睛就是为此设计的；它们中间有黑色的瞳孔，周围是有色环，背景是白色的。原因是我们所有那些眼睛无法被看到的祖先要么被杀了，要么没有繁衍后代。知道看哪里对我们来说如此重要，以至于我们进化出让别人能极容易地看出我们在看哪里的能力。

Human eyes are designed for this; they have black pupils in the middle, a colored ring, and a white background. The reason for that is that all of our ancestors who had eyes that you couldn't see either got killed or didn't reproduce. It's so valuable for us to know where to look that we've evolved so that other people can tell where we look extraordinarily easily.

那么，你应该看哪里？这是关键的问题。你应该看哪里？你应该看值得注意的地方。什么是值得注意的呢？这很复杂，但你可以简化为：你是看重要的东西还是看无关紧要的东西？你是看相关且有意义的东西还是看无关紧要的东西？答案是你看相关的东西。你如何决定什么是相关的，这个问题非常难。

Now, where do you look? That's the crucial thing. Where do you look? You look at what's worth paying attention to. What's worth paying attention to? Well, that's complicated, but you could reduce it to this: Do you look at what's important or what's irrelevant? Do you look at what's relevant and meaningful or what's irrelevant? The answer is you look at what's relevant. How you decide what's relevant, that's a very difficult question.

感知的问题主要是忽略什么的问题。你可以看的东西无限多。世界极其复杂。你可以迷失在任何事物的细节中，甚至是一个单一的物体。因此你主要忽略了99.999%的东西。你忽略地板。

The problem of perception is mostly the problem of what to ignore. There's an infinite number of things you could look at. The world is extraordinarily complicated. You can get lost in the details of anything, even a single object. So mostly you ignore 99.999% as irrelevant. You ignore the floor.

这又是一个你可以尝试的实验。如果人们坐在一个房间里，也许是在一个会议上，你说，“好吧，抬头看看天花板。（不要低头，现在）地毯是什么颜色的？”没有人知道，即使他们可能已经在这个房间里坐了一个小时。原因是，在会议上谁会关心地毯是什么颜色的？只要地板不动，你可以忽略它。大多数情况下，我们忽略所有不动的、不变的东西，我们只关注很少的几样东西。我们将目光从一个重要的东西移到另一个重要的东西，通过拍摄的快照构建一个世界。我们通过使用注意力优先级的层次结构决定什么是重要的，这与价值结构相同。

This is another experiment you can try. If people are sitting in a room, maybe at a conference, and you say, "Okay, look up at the ceiling. What color is the rug?" No one knows, even though they might have been sitting in the room for an hour. The reason is, who cares what color the rug is when you're at a conference? As long as the floor doesn't move, you can ignore it. Mostly, we ignore everything that doesn't move, that doesn't change, and we focus on a very small number of things. We move our eyes from one important thing to another, making a world out of the snapshots we take. We decide what's important by using a hierarchy of attentional prioritization, which is the same as a structure of value.

我们看重要的东西。这里有一个简单的例子。如果我走上舞台，你可能会问，“你走上舞台时看到了什么？”如果我看光反射在这块多彩瓷砖上，有很多颜色。我可以在这个表面上的反射中看到整个彩虹的颜色。如果我向前走一步，整个图案就会改变。如果我想像写实派画家那样画下来，我可以永远看着它，画一个月。到处都是取之不尽的复杂性。但当我走上舞台时，除非我服用了迷幻药，否则我并不会真的看到这些。

We look at what's important. Here's a simple example. If I walk on stage, you might ask, "What do you see when you walk on stage?" If I look at the light reflecting off this variegated tile, there's a multitude of colors. I can see a whole rainbow of colors in the reflections on this surface. If I move a foot ahead, the whole pattern changes. I could look at that forever if I wanted to paint it like a photo-realistic painter; it would take a month. There's inexhaustible complexity everywhere. But when I walk on stage, that isn't really what I see unless I'm on psychedelics.

实际上，我是认真的，因为迷幻药的作用之一是让你不再忽略事物。如果我走上舞台，我会看到椅子、一张桌子、音响设备、灯光和地毯。我会看到功能物体。我会看到工具和障碍。我会看到路径、工具和障碍。我可能看到的一个工具是椅子。椅子是用来坐的工具。这是另一种思考椅子的方式，因为你可能会认为，“是什么让两个东西都是椅子？”你可能会说，“椅子有座位、靠背和四条腿，”但你可以有没有靠背的椅子，没有四条腿的椅子，豆袋椅也是椅子，树桩可以是椅子，只要你能坐在上面，桌子可以是椅子，只要你能坐在上面。扬声器可以是椅子，只要你能坐在上面。

Actually, I mean that technically because one of the things psychedelics do is stop you from ignoring things. If I walk on the stage, what I'm going to see are chairs, a table, speakers, lights, and the carpet. I'm going to see functional objects. I'm going to see tools and obstacles. I'm going to see pathways, tools, and obstacles. One of the tools I might see is a chair. A chair is a tool for sitting. That's a different way of thinking about a chair because you might think, "What makes two things chairs?" You might say, "The chair has a seat, a back, and four legs," but you can have a chair without a back, a chair without four legs, a beanbag is a chair, a stump can be a chair if you can sit on it, and a table can be a chair if you can sit on it, and the speaker can be a chair if you can sit on it.

列出椅子的特征并说“这是椅子，因为它有这些特征”并不容易。某物之所以根本上是椅子，是因为你可以坐在上面。这可能看起来不像是一个有趣的事实，但它非常有趣，因为它暗示了所有向你宣布自己为对象的东西——也就是你字面上感知为真实的东西——都与您对目标的隐含运动密切相关。我走进这里，看到一把椅子。为什么我看到的是椅子？答案是因为你可以坐在椅子上。你可能会问，“你为什么要坐在椅子上？”答案是为了休息。你可能接着问，“为什么需要休息？”答案是，当你休息的时候，你就不会消耗那么多的能量，你也不想消耗多余的能量。如果你消耗额外的能量，你需要更多的食物。如果你没有那些食物，你会受苦。如果你缺乏足够的食物和能量，你会死。

It's not easy to make a list of features and say, "This is a chair because it has these features." The reason something is fundamentally a chair is because you can sit on it. That might not seem like an interesting fact, but it's extremely interesting because it suggests that all the things that announce themselves to you as objects—which means the things you literally perceive as real—are integrally tied up with your implicit movement towards a goal. I come in here and see a chair. Why do I see a chair? The answer is because you can sit on a chair. You might ask, "Why would you want to sit on a chair?" The answer is, You don't expend as much energy when you're resting and you don't want to expend excess energy. If you expend extra energy, you need more food. If you don't have that food, you suffer. If you lack food and energy enough, you die.

你看到椅子的一部分原因是为了不死。这个连接有点间接，因为你并不饿，但“在你的生命中可能会有一个时间找到一个休息的地方”至关重要。

One of the reasons you see a chair is so that you don't die. The connection is somewhat oblique because you're not starving, but there could be a time in your life where it's crucial to find a place to rest. 

这变得至关重要。它的意思是，你所谓的感知的对象根本不是对象。它们不是客观世界的一部分。它们实际上是微小的叙述，它们都与某种目标有关。出于必要，你不能不通过一个价值层次来看待世界。

It becomes crucial. What it means is that the so-called objects you perceive aren't objects at all. They're not part of the objective world. They're actually micro-narratives, and they're all related to some sort of goal. By necessity, you can't see the world without perceiving it through a hierarchy of value.

### 故事：注意力优先级层次的描述

这里有一个小小的转折，这是一个非常有用的知识。所以你必须仔细考虑这个问题，因为它很复杂。注意力优先级层次的描述是一个故事。

Here's a little twist on that, which is a very useful thing to know. So you got to think about this very carefully because it's complicated. The description of a hierarchy of attentional priority is a story.

现在想一想。你去看电影，也许是一部动作冒险片，比如詹姆斯·邦德。你走进电影院，坐在那里，然后发生了什么？讲故事的人揭示了路径、目标和主人公的性格，在这种情况下就是詹姆斯·邦德。詹姆斯·邦德在做什么？他在拯救世界免受某些邪恶的地下阴谋的威胁。这是詹姆斯·邦德叙述中永恒的善恶之战的一部分。詹姆斯·邦德是一个超级英雄，背后有一个超级恶棍，体现了善与恶的精神。

Okay, now think about this. You go to a movie, maybe it's an action-adventure movie, like James Bond. You go into the movie theater, you're sitting there, and what happens? The storyteller reveals the pathway, the goals, and the character of the protagonist, which in this case is James Bond. James Bond is up to something. What's he up to? He's saving the world from some evil underground conspiracy of WEF participants. It's part of the eternal battle between good and evil, played out tongue-in-cheek in the James Bond narrative. James Bond is a superhero, and there's a supervillain in the background, embodying the spirit of good versus the spirit of evil.

你看着詹姆斯·邦德，看着他注视的东西，看着他的反应。你推断出他的目标，然后将那个目标作为自己的目标。他经历的情感，你也会经历，因为你已经采纳了相同的目标。你采用了英雄的参考框架，在这种情况下是詹姆斯·邦德。通过采用这种参考框架，你可以在脑海中扮演英雄的故事，而不会在现实生活中面临那样的真正危险。可以把这看作是一种练习。

You watch James Bond, you watch what he points his eyes at, and how he reacts. You infer his goal and then adopt that goal as your own. The emotions he experiences, you experience because you've adopted the same goal. You adopt the reference frame of the hero, in this case, James Bond. By adopting that frame of reference, you can inhabit the story of the hero and play it out in your mind without undergoing the true dangers you would face if you did that in your life. 

你可以把它看作是一种练习形式。你之所以有如此强的动力去做这件事，是因为你可以以极低的成本获得大量信息，实际上你只是坐在那里，风险也很低。詹姆斯·邦德在他的超级跑车里沿着地中海的悬崖公路飞驰，这非常危险。而你只是坐在那里吃爆米花，通过间接体验获得同样的经历，并收集所有这些信息。

You can think about it as a form of practice. The reason you're so motivated to do that is because you can generate a tremendous amount of information at a very low cost, both practically, because you're just sitting there, and also in terms of risk. James Bond is in his supercar, cruising along the road by the cliffs in the Mediterranean, and it's hyper-dangerous. Meanwhile, you're just sitting there eating popcorn, you're getting the same experience vicariously and you're gathering all that information.

通过让自己接触到多个上下文中的多个英雄，你在重塑你的注意力优先级层次。当你接触到娱乐世界时，你通过一个个叙述吸收那个典型的故事，塑造自己成为你在自己生活中所能达到的詹姆斯·邦德或更高的境界。如果是一个引人入胜的戏剧，那么它就会呈现给你一种感知世界的模型，这将以深刻的方式促进你的适应。你可以将其视为自发钦佩精神的表现。

You're reshaping your hierarchy of attentional prioritization by exposing yourself to multiple heroes across multiple contexts when you expose yourself to the world of entertainment. You're absorbing that archetypal story narrative by narrative, shaping yourself into whatever approximation of James Bond or beyond you might manage in your own life. There's something compelling about that if it's a compelling drama. A compelling drama presents you with a model of perceiving the world that will facilitate your adaptation in a profound way. You can think about this as a manifestation of the spirit of spontaneous admiration.

在你的生活中，你会发现一些人令人信服、充满魅力、令人钦佩。你想模仿他们，因为这就是“钦佩”的部分含义。你想这样做的原因是他们的存在方式——他们关注世界和在世界中行动的方式——反映了最优心理和社会统一的精神。你可能会自发地钦佩某个有能力、富有成效且慷慨的人。如果他们举止优雅，拥有一定的优雅和流利的言辞，那就会夸大他们的魅力。这种魅力是你内在本能中的一种力量，驱使你朝着那个方向发展，采纳那种感知和行动的方式。钦佩的精神，是敬畏本能的反映，这是一种非常非常古老的本能，至少有六千万年的历史，它是驱使你达到最高水平的心理统一的一部分，也使我们在社会上团结起来。

In your life, you find some people compelling, charismatic, and admirable. You want to imitate them because that's part of what "admirable" means. The reason you want to do that is that their mode of being—the way they attend to the world and act in it—reflects the spirit of optimally adapted psychological and social unity. You might spontaneously admire someone who is competent, productive, and generous. If they carry themselves well, have a certain amount of grace, and speak fluently, that exaggerates their charisma. That charisma is the grip of the instinct within you to develop in that direction, to adopt that mode of perception and action. The spirit of admiration, which is a reflection of the instinct for awe, which is a very very old instinct at least 60 million years old, it's part of what drives you towards psychological unity at the highest level and also unites us socially.

当你观看英雄的叙事时，这一切都在发生。想一想《哈利·波特》系列，这是一个结构极其完善的典型叙事。哈利是一个具有魔法的孩子，他有普通的父母但也有神圣的父母，这与神话中的英雄非常相似——一个有两个父母的孤儿，既有尘世的父母也有天上的父母，就像超人一样。这反映了我们每个人既有父母——母亲和父亲——又是自然和文化的孩子。这个双重亲缘的孤儿叙事反映了这种基本现实。你是特定父母的产物，同时也是最根本意义上自然和文化的产物。这是一种原型现实。

That's all going on when you watch a narrative of the hero. Think about the Harry Potter series, which is extremely well-structured archetypally. Harry is magical; he has ordinary parents but also divine parents, typical of a mythological hero—an orphan with two sets of parents, earthly and heavenly, like Superman. This reflects the fact that we each have our parents, mother and father, and we're also children of nature and culture. The narrative of the orphan with dual parentage reflects that fundamental reality. You're a product of your particular parents and also a product of nature and culture in the most fundamental way. That's an archetypal reality.

《哈利·波特》的故事是另一场善恶之战。就所有意图和目的而言，哈利是圣乔治甚至超越圣乔治。圣乔治与龙战斗。《哈利·波特》系列的第二卷几乎是圣乔治故事的完美再现。这与《大白鲨》、《霍比特人》和《指环王》是同一个故事。这是人类最古老的故事之一——对藏金龙的永恒斗争。这个故事的道德是：有龙的地方就有金子。

The Harry Potter story is another battle between good and evil. For all intents and purposes, Harry is St. George or beyond. St. George battles the dragon. The second volume of the Harry Potter series is almost a perfect replication of the St. George story. It's the same story as Jaws, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings. It's one of the oldest stories of mankind—the eternal battle against the gold-hoarding dragon. The moral of that story is where there are dragons, there is gold. 

这是这个故事的一个变体。当亚瑟王将他的骑士们召集在圆桌旁时，圆桌骑士们聚集在一起，因为他们都是平等的。他们要去寻找圣杯，这个圣杯是永恒救赎之液的容器，或者类似的东西。没有一个骑士知道该去哪儿寻找圣杯，因此每个人都从他认为最黑暗的地方进入森林。这反映了这样一个理念：最丰富的金矿脉往往藏在最可怕的龙的爪子中。**你生命中最大的冒险将会与自愿面对存在之悲剧的程度成正比**。

Here's a variant of that story. When King Arthur assembles his men around the round table, the Knights of the Round Table gather because they are all equals. They are off to look for the Holy Grail, which is the container of the eternal redeeming liquid, or something like that. None of the knights know where to go to search for the Holy Grail, so each of them enters the forest at the place that looks darkest to him. This reflects the idea that the richest vein of gold is to be found in the clutches of the most horrifying dragon. The greatest adventure in your life is going to be found in precise proportion to your degree to voluntarily confront the tragedy of existence.

这一切都是同一个想法。这都是你无意识和有意识尝试同化一个价值层次或注意力优先级层次的一部分。你应该关注什么才能驱使你最大限度地适应？

It's all the same idea. It's all part and parcel of your unconscious and conscious attempt to assimilate a hierarchy of value or a hierarchy of attentional prioritization. What should you pay attention to that drives you towards maximal adaptation?

这是另一种思考本能的方法。想象一下你在这里，四周很安静。为什么？因为每个人的注意力都集中在发生的事情上。为什么？因为在某种程度上，所有在场的人都觉得正在发生的事情引人入胜。为什么？因为原则上，你在这里是因为你在努力向上奋斗。你为什么要努力向上奋斗？因为你已经决定向上比向下更好。我们可以深入探讨这个问题，但现在我们不会深入探讨。到目前为止，我作为一个演讲者，如果成功了，你会觉得我说的话与那个目标相关。与那个目标相关性越深，这些话就越能抓住你，让你保持沉默。这种抓住感将你们团结起来，平息每个可能会在其中表现出来的竞争动机或替代存在模式。这发生在你们每个人的内心，在某种程度上，我们都是沉默的听众，它也同时发生在社会上。这意味着同样的精神同时存在于房间里的每个人和集体中。

Here's another way of thinking about the instinct that does that. Imagine you're here, and it's quiet. Why? Because everyone's attention is focused on what's happening. Why? Because everyone in the auditorium, for one reason or another, finds what's happening gripping and engaging. Why? Because in principle, you're here because you're trying to aim up. Why are you trying to aim up? Because you've decided that aiming up is better than aiming down. We could delve into that, but at the moment we won't. To the degree that I'm being successful as a speaker, you're experiencing what I'm saying as relevant to that goal. The deeper the relevance to that goal, the more grip the words are going to have on you, and that will reduce you to silence. That grip unites you and quells every competing motivation or alternative mode of being that might otherwise manifest within. This happens within each of you, and to the degree that we're all united as an audience in silence, it also happens socially at exactly the same time. It means the same spirit inhabits every single person in the room and the collective at the same time. 

那种精神是发生在我作为演讲者和你们作为听众之间的对话之灵。这也是一种注意力优先级的层次结构。如果活动有意义，同样的事情也会发生在摇滚音乐会和体育赛事上。在那里，你们崇拜的是那些高度熟练的人们击中目标的能力。顺便提一下，“罪”这个词有两个来源。一个是希伯来语的“Chet”，另一个是希腊语的“Hamartia”。这两个词都是箭术术语，意思是“未击中目标”。

That spirit is the spirit of the dialogue occurring between me as the speaker and you as the listener. That's a hierarchy of attentional prioritization too. If the event is meaningful, the same thing happens at a rock concert and a sports event. There, you're worshipping the ability of highly skilled people to hit the target. By the way, there are two derivations of the word "sin." One is "Chet," which is from the Hebrew, and the other is "Hamartia," from the Greek. They are both archery terms that mean to miss the target.

所以，当你参加体育庆典、体育仪式时，当你在体育场中庆祝时，你实际上是在庆祝人类精确地击中目标的高超技能。这甚至会无意识地吸引你。如果你支持某支球队，有人做出了特别出色的动作并得分，全场至少支持那支球队的人都会站起来。有时甚至其他人也会站起来，像一个整体一样，举起双手，欢呼。这就像，究竟发生了什么？实际上是每个人都在参与这一高超且戏剧性的朝向目标运动的行为。

And so when you go to a sports celebration, a sports ceremony, when you worship in a sports stadium, which is what you're doing, you're celebrating the human ability to become highly skilled at precisely hitting the target. That'll even grip you unconsciously. If you're following one team and somebody makes a particularly brilliant play that results in an increment in the score, everybody in the stadium, at least everybody who's cheering for that team, will rise up. Sometimes even the other people will rise up like they're one entity, raise their hands in the air, and cheer. It's like, what the hell is going on there? It's that everybody is participating in that act of skilled, dramatic movement towards a goal.

时不时地，你会看到一个球员可能因为某种原因而一直表现不佳，但他突然完成了一次特别出色的动作，似乎超出了他当前的能力范围。全场观众会非常激动，他们会兴奋地谈论五分钟，并在接下来的两周内不断提起。这都是一种宗教庆典，即使人们并没有意识到这一点。

Now and then you see a player who maybe has been struggling for one reason or another pull off a particularly brilliant play that seems outside his current realm of competence. Everybody in the stadium is so thrilled they'll buzz away for five minutes and talk about it for two weeks. That's all a religious celebration, even though people don't know it.

这在一个非常隐含或无意识的层面上发生，但这就是它的本质。你处于一个注意力优先级的层级结构中，没有这种结构，你甚至无法看到世界。在我们的文化中，认为世界本质上是客观的这一观念不仅不真实，而且也不可能是真实的，因为用这种理论作为实践或感知科学的基础，根本无法看到世界。这是非常有趣的。让我多讲一点这是如何运作的，因为它非常有启发性，能够解释你无法理解的事情。

It's taking place at a very deeply implicit or unconscious level, but that's what it is. You inhabit a hierarchy of attentional prioritization and you can't even see the world without doing that. The idea that we have in our culture that the world is somehow fundamentally objective in nature is not only not true, it can't be true because there's no way that you can see the world using that theory as a basis for the practice or science of perception. That's extremely interesting to know. Let me tell you a little more about how this works because it's very illuminating. It will explain things to you that you just can't otherwise understand.

情绪是这样运作的。假设你心中有一个目标。你早上想去上班。我过去常问我的学生这样的问题：也许他们要写一篇文章。为什么要写这篇文章？为什么要上这门课？“嗯，我上这门课是因为我需要它作为我的专业的一部分。”为什么选择这样的专业？“嗯，我对心理学感兴趣。”为什么要来拿学位？“嗯，我觉得我需要一个学位才能找到工作。”为什么需要工作？“嗯，我需要工作来维持生计，也许还能有所作为，建立自己的名声。”为什么想这样做？“嗯，这是正确生活的一部分。”为什么要正确生活？如果正确生活，你会怎么生活？通常在这个时候，人们无法回答了，因为你可以一直用“为什么”来追问，直到他们无法再解释为止。但重点是，你总是在做某件事，因为你做的事情嵌套在一系列目标导向的行动中。

Here's how emotion works. Imagine you have a goal in mind. You want to get to work in the morning. I used to ask my students a question like this: maybe they're going to write an essay. Why are you writing the essay? Why are you in class? "Well, I'm in class because I need this class because it's part of my major." Why did you pick a major like that? "Well, I'm interested in psychology." Why did you come to get a degree? "Well, I think I need a degree to get a job." Why do you need a job? "Well, I need a job to keep body and soul together and maybe to be productive and maybe to establish a name for myself." Why do you want to do that? "Well, it's part and parcel of living properly." Why do you want to live properly and how would you live if you live properly? At that point, people are usually unable to answer because you can just push people with questions about why until they run out of explanations. But the point is, you're always doing whatever you're doing because what you're doing is nested in a sequence of goal-directed actions.

这些行动可以更加或不那么复杂。如果你不太复杂，这种嵌套可能只有两个结构深度。例如，你可能因为无聊而想喝醉。

These actions can be more or less sophisticated. If you're not very sophisticated, the nesting might be only two structures deep. For example, you might be bored and want to get drunk.

为什么呢？因为你不想感到无聊。如果有人再多问你几句，你就会抵触，你不想深入探讨这个问题。但如果你比较有见识，你会有一个相当不错的回答层次结构。你可能会说，为什么你想成为一个富有生产力和慷慨的公民？就像我说的，人们通常在这个层次就停止了，但你可以说，这是一种互惠利他主义的一部分。如果我富有生产力并且慷慨大方，这将鼓励他人也变得富有生产力和慷慨大方。如果我们大家都富有生产力和慷慨大方，那么大家的生活都会变得更好，我们的关系会更加和谐，并且持续更长时间。这将使我们都更稳定，并改善我们的社会。如果有人问为什么这很重要，你可能会说，因为替代选择类似于某种地狱般的下降，这部分反映了神圣秩序和善恶之间永恒的战斗。你可以进一步推论，问自己，你是要站在救赎英雄的一边，还是要站在永恒敌对的一边？你可以继续深入挖掘，而你挖得越深，就越会进入你可以描述为隐含宗教基础的领域。知道这些并尽可能多地将其意识化是非常有用的。

And why? Well, because you don't want to be bored. If someone pushes you a little farther than that, you hit them. You don't want to delve into it. But if you're sophisticated, you have a pretty good hierarchy of answers. You might say, well, why do you want to be a productive and generous citizen? Like I said, people usually bottom out there, but you could say, that's part of reciprocal altruism. If I'm productive and generous, that'll encourage others to be productive and generous. If we're all productive and generous together, there'll be more for everyone, we'll get along better, and for a longer period of time. That'll make us all more stable and improve our societies." If someone asks why that's relevant, you might say, well, because the alternative to that is something like a descent into something approximating hell. That's part of a reflection of the divine order and the eternal battle between good and evil. You could push it farther and say, well, are you going to be on the side of the redemptive hero or the eternal adversary? You can keep digging down, and the farther down you dig, the more you get into what you might describe as the implicit religious substrate. It's very useful to know that and to make as much of that conscious as possible.

### 焦虑：注意力层次的解体成多重路径

现在，假设你今晚来听这个演讲，因为你决定要向上追求。也许你并没有明确地表达出来，但有某种东西驱使你朝这个方向前进。然后你来到这个演讲，发现我谈论的内容不是你预期的，似乎并没有推动你朝向你的目标前进。你会感到失望，可能还会感到焦虑。失望表明你正在经历的事情与你试图追求的目标无关，可能会干扰你的进程。这就是负面情绪的作用。如果你对我说的内容感到失望，也会让你感到焦虑，因为你本来以为来这里我会说一些相关的内容。你以为你知道我是谁，但事实证明你不知道，然后你不知道我是谁，也不知道你为什么在这里。然后你感到焦虑，因为焦虑就是为了告诉你，当通向目标的路径被打断时，你需要注意。

Now, imagine you've come to this talk tonight because you've decided to aim up. Maybe you haven't formulated that precisely, but something is driving you in this direction. Then you come to the talk and find out that I'm talking about something that isn't what you expected and doesn't seem to be moving you along on your pathway forward to that end. You're going to be disappointed, and you might be anxious too. Disappointment signals that you're experiencing something that's not relevant to the goal you are attempting to pursue and that might be interfering with it. That's what negative emotion does. If you're disappointed in what I say, that also makes you anxious because you assumed that you would come here and I would say something relevant. You assumed that you knew who I was, and then it turned out that you didn't, and then you don't know who I am, and you don't know what you're doing here. Then you get anxious, and the reason you get anxious is because that's what anxiety is for. It tells you when the pathway to your goal has been disrupted.

因此，现在出现了多条路径。想象你正在开车去上班，车突然坏了。你会感到焦虑，因为你本来在你的世界中顺利前行，一切都简化为单一的简单。你并不是在开一辆车，而是在驾驶一辆带你去你想去的地方的东西，它只是按照预期在路径上运行。然后它坏了，你被迫停在路边。你会感到焦虑，因为你怎么去上班？如果你不去上班，你的老板会不高兴吗？也许这是你这周犯的第三个错误，如果你被解雇怎么办？你买这辆车是不是太蠢了？也许你根本不应该有车，也许你应该步行或骑自行车上班，因为这样可以拯救地球。现在你得把车送去修理，但上次你去修理厂被宰了，因为你对车辆不太了解。你对技术总体上有些愚笨，你是不是太笨了？你的妻子会怎么看你？这就是焦虑。

Imagine you're driving your car to work and it quits. You get anxious because you were beetling along quite nicely in your world, and everything was reduced to a unidimensional simplicity. You weren't in a car as an object; you were in a thing that took you to where you wanted to go, and it was just doing what it was supposed to do, tracking you along the pathway to your goal. Then it fails, and you're off on the side of the road. You get anxious because how the hell are you going to get to work, and what if you don't get to work? Is your boss not going to be very happy with you? Maybe this is the third mistake you've made this week, and what if you get fired? Weren't you an idiot for buying this car? Maybe you shouldn't have a car at all. Maybe you should walk to work or take a bicycle because that would save the planet. Now you have to take your car to a mechanic, but the last time you went to the mechanic, you got ripped off because you're too stupid about vehicles to manage one. You're kind of stupid about technology in general. Aren't you stupid? Maybe you're too stupid, and isn't your wife going to... That's anxiety.

这就是多重路径出现的情况，对吧？焦虑意味着注意力层次的解体成多重路径。你感到焦虑并且感觉不好，因为现在你的身体无法计算出你需要投入多少能量来达到目标。你无法组织世界，你可能会消耗比补充更多的资源。如果你继续这样做，你就会死。焦虑是复杂性重新出现的信号——混沌，永恒的混沌之龙重新出现，因为你的叙事崩溃了。这就是负面情绪的意义——组织叙事的崩溃。

And that's the emergence of a multiplicity of pathways, right? What anxiety signifies is the degeneration of an attentional hierarchy into multiplicity. The reason you get anxious and it feels bad is because now your body can't compute how much energy you have to put out to get to your goal. You can't organize the world, and you're apt to use more resources than you'll replenish. If you continue to do that, then you'll die. Anxiety is a signal that complexity has re-emerged—chaos, the eternal dragon of chaos, has re-emerged because your narrative has collapsed. That's what negative emotion signifies—the collapse of an organizing narrative. 

知道这些非常有趣。所以，你会感到积极。如果我走上舞台，我知道我应该走到舞台前面，因为我要和你们讲话。我想和你们讲话，因为这很有价值。

It's very interesting to know. So you feel positive. If I walk on the stage, I know I'm supposed to go to the front of the stage because I have to talk to you. I want to talk to you because it's valuable. 

这嵌套在一个价值层级中。如果我看到通往舞台前方的清晰路径，这会产生积极的情绪，推动我前进。积极的情绪推动你前进，这就是它的作用。积极情绪是如何与行动联系在一起的。如果你充满热情，那是因为你看到了通向有价值目标的道路。那种热情表现为积极的动机，推动你前进。

That's nested in a hierarchy of value. If I see a clear pathway to the front of the stage, it produces positive emotion that impels me forward. Positive emotion impels you forward; that's what it's for. It's how positive emotion is linked to action. If you're enthusiastic, it's because you see a pathway forward to a valued goal. That enthusiasm manifests as positive motivation to move forward. 

如果你前进并且取得了效果，你的大脑会追踪这个事实。这与多巴胺的释放有关，顺便说一句，多巴胺也是可卡因释放的东西。即使你只是成功地走向你想去的地方，你的大脑也会追踪你正在做的事情。在你进行这些活动时，有些回路会被激活，如果你所做的事情达到了预期结果，多巴胺会充满这些活跃的神经元，使它们生长和繁荣。当你练习某个有效的方法时，活跃的回路会被多巴胺浸润，使其变得更强。这感觉很好，这是积极情绪的一部分。积极情绪推动你前进，并鼓励你养成这种练习的习惯。

If you're moving forward and it's working, your brain tracks that fact. That's linked to dopamine release, by the way, which is what cocaine releases. It's linked to dopamine release, and the other thing your brain is doing even when you're just walking to where you want to go. If you're successfully walking there, your brain tracks what you're doing. There are circuits that are activated while you're doing it, and if what you're doing results in the result you desired, then the dopamine floods those little neurons that are active and makes them grow and flourish. As you practice something that works, the active circuit is bathed in dopamine, making it stronger. This feels good; it's part of positive emotion. Positive emotion moves you forward and encourages developing a habit of that practice. 

我会说的一件事是，不要养成追求对你不利的事物的习惯，因为那会内化到你的身上。如果你对某样东西上瘾了，就会在你体内养出一个小怪物，它会不断成长，尽管你明知不好，它仍会追求同一个目标。这不是一个好的结果。积极情绪还表明这是一个能量节约的信号。当我朝目标前进时，每走一步都会消耗更少的能量。这意味着积极情绪表明你的行动在向目标前进时变得越来越高效。消极情绪则表明事情变得过于复杂，难以应对，而积极情绪表明你正在接近目标，每一步都需要更少的能量输出。这就是情绪，这值得了解。

One of the things I would say is don't make a habit of pursuing things that aren't good for you because you build that into you. That's what happens if you become addicted to something. You build a little monster inside you that's grown. It's there, it's after one goal despite everything else. Not a good outcome. Positive emotion also signals the fact that it's an energy conservation observation. As I move forward towards my goal with each step I take, it's going to take less energy to get to the goal. That means positive motion signifies the increasing efficiency of your action as you move towards a goal. Negative emotion signifies the fact that things have got too complex for you to manage, and positive emotion signifies that you're approaching your goal and that there's less demand on energy output with every step forward. That's emotion, and that's worth knowing.

### 和平：同一个叙事

当你看电影时，你会推断出主角或反派的目标。你推断出屏幕上角色的目标，并将这个目标当作自己的目标，然后在你自己的身体里表现出这些情绪，模仿屏幕上角色的结构。你把这一切都在内心里演绎出来，这也是你理解他人的方式。你不会听别人说话，然后推断他们的意思，接着再推断他们在想什么。事情不是那样运作的。你会听别人说话，直到弄清楚他们在干什么。一旦弄清楚他们的意图，你就能采用他们的视角。一旦采用了他们的视角，你就会产生相同的情绪，这让你们达成了共识。

When you're watching a movie, you infer the goal of the protagonist or the villain. You infer the goal of the character that's being portrayed on the screen. You adopt that goal as your own, then you play out the emotions in your own body which mimics the structure of the character being portrayed on the screen. You live that all out inside you, and that's also how you understand other people. You don't listen to someone and then figure out what they're saying and then infer what they're thinking. That isn't how it works. You listen to someone until you figure out what they're up to. As soon as you figure out what they're up to, you can adopt that frame of reference. As soon as you adopt that frame of reference, you have the same emotions. That's what makes you united.

然后你会想，看，这里有5000个人。如果这里有5000只黑猩猩，你们会互相撕裂对方，因为没有人能知道其他人在干什么。但因为你们所有人都在以相同的方式关注同一件事，所以你们几乎拥有相同的情绪状态。这意味着你的行为可以立即对彼此预测，这与和平没有区别。

Then you think, look, there's 5,000 people in here. If there were 5,000 chimpanzees, you guys would be tearing each other to shreds because no one would be able to know what anyone else was up to. But because all of you are here paying attention to the same thing in the same way, you have virtually identical emotional states. That means instantly your behavior is rendered predictable to one another, and there's no difference between that and peace.

它们是同一回事。这意味着一个文明、生产性、和平社会的前提条件是每个人都生活在同一个叙事中。你可能会说，“我们不需要相同的叙事，”但实际上我们需要。如果我们生活在不同的叙事中，那么我们在情感上就会朝不同的方向走，我们就无法理解彼此。这会导致冲突，冲突很快就会变得致命。一个文明社会的前提是每个人都团结在同一个叙事中。

They're the same thing. What that means is that one of the predicates of a civil, productive, peaceful society is that everyone inhabits the same narrative. You might say, "We don't need the same narrative," but yes, we do. If we inhabit different narratives, then we're running emotionally in different directions, and we will not understand each other. This leads to conflict, which can become deadly very quickly. It's a precondition for a civil society that everyone is united in the same narrative.

### 暴政：后现代主义者所认为的权力统治

这引出了一个问题：既然我们统一了，叙事是什么？另一个问题是：现在叙事应该是什么？后现代主义者发现我们通过故事来看待世界，但他们的口号变得对宏大叙事持怀疑态度，而这些叙事是统一的叙事。对宏大叙事持怀疑态度是可以理解的，但你会遇到内部不和的问题，如果没有统一的叙事，你就会内部分裂，并且会有社会不和的问题。如果我们不是为了同样的理由看着同样的东西，我们就无法相处。这些是大问题。

This begs the question: What is the narrative insofar as we're unified? Another question is: What should the narrative be right now? The postmodernists figured out that we looked at the world through a story, but their mantra became skeptical of meta-narratives, which are uniting narratives. It's all well and good to be skeptical about meta-narratives, but you run into the problem of internal disunion. Without a uniting narrative, you're divided against yourself, and there's a problem of social disunity. If we're not looking at the same thing for the same reason, we can't get along. These are big problems.

后现代主义者掩盖这种巨大灾难性问题的方法是提出一个观点，即团结我们的叙事只是权力和压迫。他们认为，指导你内在组织的基本动机——你自己的内部暴政——是压迫你的本我或自然自我。如果你建立关系，比如婚姻，被视为父权制的压迫。如果你组织商业关系，它被看作是相互剥削的关系。这种观点一直延伸到政治层级，并回溯到过去。

The way the postmodernists glided over this immense, cataclysmic problem was to propose that the narrative that unites us is just one of power and oppression. They suggest that the fundamental motivation that guides even your internal organization—your own internal tyranny—is oppressing your id or natural self. If you establish a relationship, like a marriage, it's seen as patriarchal oppression. If you organize a business relationship, it's a relationship of mutual exploitation. This perspective extends all the way up the political hierarchy and back into the past.

再没有比这更悲观的人类存在观了。我总是把它看作一种隐含的忏悔。就像，“所以你认为世界都是由权力支配的，对吧？好吧，我知道你在玩什么游戏，并试图证明什么。”这完全是荒谬的，因为如果你对自己施行暴政，你会很痛苦并且不断反抗。我确信你们所有人都尝试过某个时候用鞭子逼迫自己做某件事，发现你们自由得如此绝望，以至于你会反抗自己的暴政。试试告诉自己做某事，看看你是否会做。例如，新年决心“我每周去健身房三次，每次两小时。”不，你不会。你会坚持三天，然后找借口。反叛的一部分会找到借口，然后你不会去做。这是一个谜，因为你会认为你可以告诉自己做什么，否则你是谁呢？你是那个告诉自己该做什么的人，但你却不听从自己的话，那么那部分到底是什么？那肯定是你自己。

A more dismal view of human existence couldn't possibly be formulated. I always think about it as a kind of implicit confession. It's like, "So you think the world's all run by power, do you? Okay, I know what game you're playing and attempting to justify." It's completely preposterous because if you tyrannize yourself, you're going to be miserable and constantly rebel. I'm sure all of you have tried at one time or another to force yourself to do something with a whip, so to speak, and found that you're so condemned to be free that you'll resist your own tyranny. Try telling yourself to do something and see if you do it. For instance, New Year's resolutions like "I'm going to the gym three times a week, two hours a day." No, you're not. You'll last three days and then find an excuse. The rebellious part of you will find an excuse, and you won't do it. It's a mystery because you'd think you could tell yourself what to do, because otherwise, who are you? You're the part that told yourself what to do, but you don't listen, so what the hell's that part? That's you, that's for sure.

你甚至不能高效地施行自我暴政。如果你已婚，试试对你的妻子施行暴政，看看效果如何。它可能会有效十分钟，因为她没有你大，但她要狡猾得多。你得明天早上和她一起醒来。即使你赢得了争论——虽然你不会赢——她会在第二天报复你，毫无疑问。你被那种关系约束了，因为你需要持续的互动。它们必须是相对和平的，否则你们会互相撕扯。如果是不断的冲突，你们会筋疲力尽并死去。它必须至少是互相加强的。也许如果你们处理得好，你们可以以一种随着时间推移改善互动的方式互动。或许你已经足够聪明，如果你在那条路上，你会在当下体验到你所希望与某人拥有的那种关系。类似于游戏精神和浪漫爱情。这将是一个本能的表现，引导你在关系中跨越时间。

You can't even tyrannize yourself efficiently. If you're married, try tyrannizing your wife and see how well that works. It might work for 10 minutes because she's not as big as you, but she's a lot sneakier. You have to wake up with her tomorrow morning. Even if you win the fight, which you won't, she'll take it out on you the next day, and no wonder. You're bound in that relationship by the necessity of continual iterative interactions. They have to be moderately peaceful, or you'll tear each other apart. If it's constant conflict, you'll both exhaust yourselves and die. It has to be at least mutually reinforcing. Maybe if you have it together, you could interact in a way that improves your interactions over time. And maybe you're wise enough so that if you were on that track, the way you would experience that in the moment would be exactly the kind of relationship you'd want to have with someone, something like the spirit of play and romantic love. That would be the manifestation of an instinct that orients you across time properly in a relationship.

这真是太美妙了，不是吗？这种游戏和浪漫爱情的本能可能是你内心最智慧的声音，是你对意义最深的指引。在婚姻或家庭中，如果你有孩子，没有什么比能够参与到类似自愿游戏中的事情更令人愉快了。如果你能按自己的意愿安排世界，那岂不是大多数时间都在玩耍？这是等同的。基督说，除非你们变得像小孩子一样，否则你们永远不能进入天国。这是什么意思呢？这意味着要重新发现我们在孩提时代所具有的那种对生活的深度沉浸和游戏的能力，因为我们不得不成熟，所以无法保持这种状态，但如果我们足够智慧和小心，我们可以在成年后重新发现这种能力。

And that's such a wonderful thing to know, right? That instinct for play and romantic love might be the voice of the wisest instinct you have, the deepest orientation to meaning that you have. There's nothing more delightful in a marriage or in a family if you have children than to be able to engage in something like voluntary play. If you could set up the world the way you want, wouldn't it be something if mostly what you did was akin to play? And that's equivalent. Christ in the gospel says that unless you become like a little child, you'll never enter the kingdom of heaven. What does that mean? It means to rediscover that intense immersion in life and that capacity for play that characterized us all as children, which we can't maintain because we have to mature, but that we could rediscover as adults if we were sufficiently wise and careful. 

如果你有朋友，你对朋友施加暴政，那你就没有朋友；你只是一个有帮手的恶霸。一旦你跌倒，他们会在背后捅你一刀，因为你周围都是一些懦弱的精神病患者。他们只是在等待机会把你干掉。这显然不是友谊。

If you have friends, you don't tyrannize your friends, then you don't have friends; you're just a bully with henchmen. As soon as you stumble, they'll stab you in the back because you've surrounded yourself with craven psychopaths. They're just waiting for the moment to take you out. That's not friendship, obviously.

如果你经营一家企业，那些有经验的经营者会知道这是真的。如果你欺骗你的客户会怎么样? 你可能会得逞一两次，但很快就会传开，然后你就完蛋了，愤愤不平，因为你的愚蠢诡计没有成功。但是，如果你公平交易，可靠，兑现承诺，并且对员工和客户还算不错，他们会对你感到满意，他们会回头光顾，并告诉他们的朋友你做得多么好。你会繁荣，而这不是随意的。

If you're running a business, those of you who've run businesses and have a clue know this is true. What happens if you rip off your customers? You can get away with it once or twice, but word gets around in no time flat, and then you're done and bitter and resentful because your idiot machinations didn't work. But if you engage in fair trade, are reliable, deliver what you promised, and are half-decently good to your employees and the people you work for, they will be pleased with you, they'll come back, and they'll talk to their friends about how well you did. You'll flourish, and none of that's arbitrary. 

这些都是某种形式的注意力优先级表现。你去客户家，也许你是个水管工，首先要做的是听他们的问题。至少你有足够的智慧去参与对话，真正想了解问题是什么，然后真正想解决它。如果你勤勉地这样做，他们会感到满意，因为他们不希望地毯上都是污水。你的利益是一致的，如果你提供你所承诺的，他们会产生积极的情绪，平息他们的焦虑。这是你提供的服务，演绎了正确的故事。你是勤劳、慷慨和诚实的，这并非是随意的，即这作为内在统一和让你能够在和平且富有成效的社会中生存的道德准则。

That's all guided by a manifestation of a certain form of attentional priority. You go to your customer's house, maybe you're a plumber, and the first thing you do is listen to their problem. At least you have enough sense to engage in dialogos, right? You actually want to hear what the problem is and then actually want to solve it. If you do that with some diligence, they'll be pleased because they don't want sewage all over the rug. Your interests are aligned, and if you offer what you promise, you'll evoke positive emotion in them, quelling their anxiety. That's the service you're offering, acting out the proper story. You're productive, generous, and honest, and there's nothing arbitrary about that as an ethos that unites you internally and makes it possible for you to exist in a peaceful and productive society.

你不能在没有通过一个故事看世界的情况下看世界。那么，你正在演绎什么故事？这是值得思考的，因为你在演绎某个故事或一组碎片化的故事。如果你是一个享乐主义者，从一个心血来潮到另一个心血来潮，你也在某种程度上被一个统一的故事所团结，这个故事可以团结你，平息你的焦虑，产生积极的动力，并把你和其他人联系在一起。那个故事是什么？它不是一个随意权力的故事。我们知道这一点——4%到5%的人是精神病患者，这不是0，但96%的人不是那样的。这不成功。如果你是个骗子，你可以拿着棍子走一段路，但人们很快就会看穿你，你很可能会很快遇到一个凄惨的结局。

You can't see the world without looking at it through a story. So, what story are you acting out? That's worth thinking about because you're acting out some story or a combination of fragmentary stories. If you're a hedonist going from one whim to another, you're somewhat united by acting out a uniting story that works to unite you, quell your anxiety, produce positive motivation, and unite you with other people. What is that story? It's not a story of arbitrary power. We know this—4 or 5% of people are psychopathic, which isn't none, but 96% aren't that way. It's not successful. You can get somewhere with a club if you're a liar, but people figure you out pretty fast, and it's probable you'll meet a dismal end relatively quickly. 

你可能比那些只是躺在家里等死的人更成功，但你不如那些真正采用更复杂和更有成效的伦理观的人成功。因此，认为是权力统治并通过统治将我们团结起来的说法是你能讲出的最愤世嫉俗的故事，而且完全没有事实依据。

You might be more successful than the person who just lies at home in bed and dies, but you're not as successful as somebody who actually adopts a more sophisticated and productive ethos. So the notion that it's power that rules and that unites us through dominion is the most cynical story you can possibly tell, and there's absolutely no factual basis for it whatsoever. 

### 牺牲：走向应许之地

正确的伦理观应该是慷慨的自我牺牲。显然，这在与孩子的关系中尤其如此。牺牲的主题是大多数救赎故事的核心。哈利·波特在《哈利·波特》系列中必须死而复生才能打败邪恶。耶稣的故事是另一个例子。匹诺曹试图从鲸鱼的腹中救出他的父亲，这意味着复兴被混乱吞噬的死亡文化。这几乎杀死了他，但他作为一个真正的人类复活。这种牺牲的概念是基本的——工作就是为了未来的稳定而牺牲现在的快乐。最终的牺牲就是你自己，这深深植根于犹太-基督教传统，是我们文化的叙事基石。

No, the proper ethos is something like generous self-sacrifice. That's especially true in relationship to children, obviously. The notion that power rules and unites us through dominion is the most cynical story you can tell, with no factual basis. The proper ethos is something like generous self-sacrifice, especially in relation to children. The sacrificial motif is core to most redemptive stories. Harry Potter in the Harry Potter series has to die and be reborn to defeat evil. Jesus' story is another example. Pinocchio tries to rescue his father from the belly of a whale, which means to revivify dead cultures swallowed up by chaos. It nearly kills him, but he rises as a genuine human being. This notion of sacrifice is fundamental—work is sacrificing the joys of the present for the stability of the future. And you might ask, well, what's the ultimate sacrifice? The ultimate sacrifice is something like yourself, deeply embedded in the Judeo-Christian tradition, the narrative substrate of our culture. 

这不是因为人们是相信天上有个老人的傻瓜，而是因为我们是智慧的，已经在成千上万年中聚集了集体智慧，即使没有明确地说出来，也在故事中表述了它。我们生活在一个故事中，甚至科学界现在也知道这一点。我们生活在一个故事中，所以问题是：你的故事会是什么？你甚至可以问自己这个问题，这是值得做的。

This isn't because people are fools who believe in an old man in the sky, but because we're wise and have aggregated collective wisdom over tens of thousands of years, formulating it in stories even if not explicitly. We live in a story, and even the scientific community knows that now. We live in a story, so the question is: What's your story going to be? You can even ask yourself that and that's worth doing.

想象一下你可以过你想要的生活故事。如果你像关心一个你在乎的人那样照顾自己，你如何才能把你的生活过得最好，并让周围的事情变得最好？好好问问自己那会是什么样子，为什么你会瞄准其他任何东西。也许你心怀怨恨，你的一半灵魂宁愿在地狱里，如果你能看到你的敌人在那里受苦。但不要无意识地追求那样，因为它可能会发生，然后你会发现那是真正的地狱，如果是你造成的，你会最痛苦。

Imagine you could live out the story you wanted. If you were taking care of yourself as someone you cared for,  Say, how could I conduct my life so that I could be the best I could be, and the best things that could happen, happen around me?  It's good to ask yourself what that would be like and why you would aim at anything different. Maybe you're bitter and resentful, and half your soul would rather be in hell if you could see your enemies suffer there. But don't pursue that unconsciously because it might happen, and then you'll find out that is really hell, and if you brought it about, you'll suffer the most.

眼前有一个替代选择，类似于更丰富的生活，爱你的邻居如同爱你自己，在追求最高善的过程中自愿自我牺牲。那是一个逐步建立山上的城或圣城耶路撒冷的故事。

There's an alternative that beckons right in front of you, something like life more abundant, loving your neighbor as yourself, voluntary self-sacrifice in the pursuit of the highest good. That's a story aiming step by step at establishing the city on the hill or the holy Jerusalem.

应许之地，每个叙事的永恒目的地，这一切都是真实的。明确地知道这一点是好的，因为它有助于你对齐自己。你需要对齐，因为生活是艰难的。如果你内在分崩离析，当风暴来临时，你会淹死，可能你爱的人也会一起淹死。这不是一个好的结局。你必须把自己收拾好，你要么这样做，要么这样做。做到这一点的方法是全力以赴地向上，不仅像你的生命取决于此，而且像你的灵魂取决于此。因为确实如此。这是真实的情况。所以这就是故事。

The promised land, the eternal destination of every narrative, all of that is just true. It's good to know it explicitly because it helps you line yourself up. You need to be lined up because life is tough. If you're internally disaggregated and broken, then when the storms come, you're going to drown, and maybe everyone you love with you. That's not a good end. You have to get your act together, and you do that or else, and you do that by determining with all your might to aim up, not like your life depended on it, but like your soul depends on it because it does. That's genuinely the case. So that's the story.

谢谢你们。我现在要邀请我的妻子上台。我们将回答一些问题。非常感谢你们的时间和关注。

Thank you for that. I'm going to invite my wife back on stage. We're going to answer some questions. Thank you very much for your time and attention.

### Q&A

#### 设备问题

**Tammy**

第一个问题是，“我们爱你，乔丹。”这不是一个问题。那是我的问题。

The first question was, "We love you, Jordan." That's not a question. That's my question.

**Jordan**

好吧，谢谢，感情是相互的。

Well, thank you. The feeling is mutual.

**Tammy**

稍等一下，绝对在这儿。它消失了。

One sec, it's definitely here. It disappears.

**Jordan**

遇到Wi-Fi问题。

Having Wi-Fi trouble.

**Tammy**

是的，我能看到它，但它消失了。我想知道我能不能记住它们。

Yeah, I could see it, but then it disappears. Wonder if I can remember them.

**Jordan**

要不你先解决这个问题。我来回答观众的问题。好吧，你可以找约翰帮你。

Do you want to fix that? I'll take an audience question. Okay, you can maybe get John to give you a hand with that.

#### COVID封锁对年轻人教育的影响

我们遇到了一些技术问题。前排有人有问题吗？我想问整个观众，但我看不见你们大多数人。是的，先生，你有什么问题？

We have a bit of technical trouble. Is there someone in the first row that has a question? I'd ask the whole crowd, but I can't see most of you. Yes, sir, what's your question?


这位先生是一名高中老师，他问我对COVID封锁对年轻人教育的影响有何看法。嗯，我们知道一些后果。我们知道全球的学生失去了相当于至少一年的教育，相当于大约一个智商点，这会带来长期的经济后果，这显然不是好事。我们肯定会发现，如果还没有发现的话，封锁的后果远比封锁所带来的好处严重得多。这显然是事实。

This gentleman is a high school teacher and he asked me for my thoughts on the consequences for the education of young people of the COVID lockdown. Well, we know some of the consequences. We know that students around the world have lost something approximating at least a year of education, and that's equivalent to about one IQ point, by the way. There are substantive long-term economic consequences to that, so that's not good. We're definitely going to find out, if we haven't already, that the consequences of the lockdown were far more dire than whatever good the lockdown did. That's clearly obvious.

可能已经是事实了。所以，这是一个灾难，还有很多我们做过的事情的后果我们并不了解。例如，人们戴了几年的口罩，这意味着正在学习说话的孩子在学习说话时无法看到人们的脸部表情。我们不知道这对他们从面部表情中推断情感的能力有何影响。我们知道许多孩子因此而遭受语言发展迟缓。我们也不知道让13到15岁的孩子在家待了两年对他们的士气有多大打击，他们变得多么胆怯，对世界有多么恐惧，这些长远的后果是什么。

It's probably already been the case. So that's, you know, that's a catastrophe, and then there's all sorts of things that we don't understand about what we did. So, for example, people wore masks for a couple of years, and that meant that children who are learning to speak didn't get to watch people's faces while they were learning to speak. We have no idea what that did to their ability to infer emotion from facial gestures. We know that many children are suffering from developmental language delays as a consequence. We have no idea how badly we demoralized people who were, let's say, 13 to 15, who had to stay at home for two years, how much more timid we made them, how much more afraid of the world, what the long-term consequences of that would be.

我能记得一些我13、14或15岁时的感受，如果我当时被关在家里两年，我不仅会疯掉，还会把我的父母逼疯。我们也不知道有多少父母被逼疯，但看看周围的政治形势，你会发现相当大比例的人口处于这种状态。我们干扰了青少年建立友谊的能力。我们在屏幕开始占主导地位的时候把他们转向了屏幕。我们干扰了小孩子建立初步社交关系的能力，并把他们转向屏幕。

I can tell you, I can remember to some degree what it was like to be 13 or 14 or 15, and if I would have been locked at home for two years, I would have not only gone out of my mind, I would have driven my parents stark raving mad. So, we also have no idea how many parents were driven stark raving mad, but if you look at the political situation that surrounds us, you'd have to say that it was a pretty hefty proportion of the population. So, what else did we do? Oh, we disrupted the ability of teenagers to form friendships. We turned them towards screens at exactly the same time when screens were starting to dominate. We interfered with the ability of young kids to form initial social relationships and turned them towards screens.

这就够了，这是一个不错的开始。我是说，这真是一个灾难。我们作为一个社会所做的是：我们模仿了世界上最糟糕的极权国家，像《天塌了》里的小鸡一样匆忙行动，我们在全世界都这样做了。多么可悲，多么彻底的可悲。我们很可能在面对一种20年前只会被认为是流感的疾病时这样做了，因为我们无法区分病毒变种。所以，严肃地说，我们确实该感到羞耻。

That'll do, man, that's not a bad start. I mean, what a catastrophe. Here's what we did as a society: we imitated the worst totalitarian state in the world in a panicked, the-sky-is-falling, Chicken Little rush, and we did that everywhere in the world. So, how pathetic, how utterly pathetic. We likely did that in the face of a disease that 20 years ago would have just been regarded as a flu because we wouldn't have been able to distinguish the viral variants. So, seriously, shame on us, that's for sure.

#### 如果社会上的部落主义团体胜过了个人主义团体，那么个人主义者该怎么办？

如果社会上的部落主义团体胜过了个人主义团体，那么个人主义者该怎么办？放弃个人主义，被淘汰，还是其他什么？

这是一个好问题。如果部落主义团体比个人主义团体更有竞争力，那么个人主义者该怎么办？你可以把个人主义者看作是经典的自由主义者，甚至是经典的新教自由主义者。我倾向于这种观点，因为我认为如果你要感知和分类人类，最高层次的分类应该是个体。

If tribalist globe groups in society outcompete the individualist groups, what's an individualist to do? Give up individualism, be outcompeted, or something else? Yeah, that's a good question. So the question is, if tribalist groups outcompete individualists, what's an individualist to do? The individual, you might think about the individualists as something like classic liberals or maybe even classic Protestant liberals, and you know I have a tilt in that direction because I think that if you perceive categorize human beings, the superordinate level of categorization should be the individual.

当我演讲时，我从不对着人群讲话。我对的是个体。没有人群，只有个体。如果你曾经公开演讲，这是一个非常好的技巧。你害怕公开演讲吗？那是因为你在对着一群人说话。难怪你会害怕。谁愿意对着一群人说话？没有人。他们只是在等着把你撕成碎片。你不要对着一群人说话，你只对着个体说话，你知道该怎么做。所以，你只对着个体说话，即使有5000个个体，那也没关系。如果你与一个人建立联系，你就能立刻与几乎所有人建立联系，这样可以立刻消除你在演讲时的社交焦虑。这表明你实际上在正确的分辨率层次上理解了群体，因为这就是你的焦虑消失的原因。

When I'm lecturing, I don't talk to the crowd ever. I talk to individuals. There is no crowd, there's individuals. If you're ever public speaking, this is a really good thing to know. You're afraid to speak publicly? Well, that's because you're speaking to the mob. Well, no wonder you're afraid. Who the hell wants to speak to a mob? No one. They're just waiting in the wings to tear you into pieces. You don't talk to the mob, you just talk to individuals, and you know how to do that. So, you just talk to individuals, and there's 5,000 of them, and that's okay. If you make contact with one person, you instantly make contact with almost everyone, and so that'll knock out your social anxiety when you're speaking right away. That shows that you're actually apprehending the group at the right level of resolution because that's why your anxiety goes away, right?

这也是非常有用的知识。这是值得深入思考的事情。如果你能够最佳地理解情况，你的焦虑就会消失。你可能会想，即使在非常严峻的情况下，你能做到这一点吗？也许当你面对所爱之人的死亡时，答案是，这很难，但这并不意味着不可能。只是意味着很难。

That's also something really useful to know. It's something to really think about deeply. If you apprehended the situation optimally, your anxiety would disappear. You might think, well, could you even do that in a really dire situation? Maybe when you're facing the death of someone you love, and the answer is, well, that's pretty damn difficult, no doubt, but that doesn't mean it's impossible. It just means it's difficult.

经典自由主义观点的问题在于它根本上是错误的。这是我所能告诉你的。你可能会认为，例如，一种经典自由主义新教的逻辑后果是个体自我和自我实现的概念，以及相关的个体可以是理智的想法，如果你是理智的，那是因为你内部组织良好。你把自己整理好了，一切都井然有序，所以理智是你内部组织完整性的标志。也许你可以优化这一点；那将是某种自我实现的东西，这是构建理智的一种方式，但这不对。

The thing about the classic liberal view is it's wrong, fundamentally. Now here's why, as far as I can tell. So, you might think, for example, one of the logical consequences of a kind of classic liberal Protestantism is the idea of the individual self and also the idea of self-actualization, and the associated idea that you as an individual can be sane, and the associated idea that if you're sane it's because you're well-organized internally, right? You've put yourself together properly, everything's in place, and so sanity would be a marker of the integrity of your internal organization. Maybe you can optimize that; that would be something like self-actualization, and that's one way of construing sanity, but it's not right.


我部分是这样学到的，尽管几乎所有的临床心理学家，所有伟大的心理学家——弗洛伊德、荣格、阿德勒、卡尔·罗杰斯和亚伯拉罕·马斯洛等等——他们真的相信这一点。他们采用了新教自由主义路线，这种个人主义路线。唯一真正不这样做的心理学家是让·皮亚杰，他是发展心理学家。他指出，早期的儿童在两岁时会整合自己，所以他们现在有了一点自我控制。三岁的孩子会这样做。他们内部有些组织，他们可以某种程度上控制自己，不像两岁的孩子，他们会从一个动机状态跳到另一个，从快乐到悲伤只需一瞬间。

Now I learned this partly, although almost all clinical psychologists, all the great psychologists, Freud and Jung and Adler and Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow and so forth, they really believed that. They took the Protestant liberal line, this individualist line. The only psychologist who really didn't was Jean Piaget, who was a developmental psychologist. He noted that early on, children by the age of two kind of integrate themselves, so now they have a bit of self-control. Children by the age of three do that. Sorry, they're somewhat internally organized; they can sort of control themselves, unlike two-year-olds who just sort of move from one motivational state to another, from joy to sorrow in the snap of a finger.

到孩子三岁时，他或她可以在与另一个孩子的关系中组织自己，你会看到这种情况发生，因为孩子们开始一起玩。当他们一起玩时，他们会建立一个共同的目标。这就是你玩棋盘游戏时所做的，对吗？你玩大富翁。目标是什么？赚到所有的钱。

By the time a child's three, he or she can organize himself, let's say, in relationship to another child, and you see that happening because children start to play together. When they play together, what they do is they establish a shared goal. That's what you do when you play a board game, right? You play Monopoly. What's the goal? Get all the money. 

嗯，为什么你想玩大富翁？我们不会进行哲学讨论，我们要玩大富翁。所以，你接受它作为一个方便和必要的虚构，以便游戏可以进行，但游戏的规则是你必须遵守相同的目标。你必须建立相同的目标。当两个孩子一起假装玩时，如果他们在玩过家家，一个男孩和一个女孩，他们必须同意他们在玩过家家，然后他们必须接受他们分配的角色，然后他们必须创造性地朝着相同的方向前进。这意味着他们在社会和心理上同时统一了自己。

Well, why do you want to play Monopoly? We're not going to have a philosophical discussion, we're going to play Monopoly, right? So, you adopt it as a convenient and necessary fiction so the game can proceed, but the rule of the game is you have to abide by the same goal. You have to establish the same goal. When two kids are pretend playing together, if they're playing house, a boy and a girl, they have to agree that they're playing house, and then they have to accept their assigned rules, and then they have to move creatively towards the same direction. What that means is that they've unified themselves socially and psychologically at the same time.

如果他们做到这一点，这真是太酷了：如果一个男孩和一个女孩一起玩，他们玩过家家，很有趣，那么他们就会想再玩一次。你可以把游戏看作是朝着一个目标进行的一系列行动，那就是玩过家家，这种幻想实际上是练习，但这样做很有趣。你找到一个可以一起玩的伙伴，这很有趣，那么你就会想重复做这件事，这就是友谊。朋友是那种你可以反复一起玩游戏的人，因此这就是一组游戏。朋友就是你可以一起玩一组游戏的人。

If they do that optimally, this is so cool: if a boy and girl play together, they play house and it's fun, then they'll want to play again. You can think of the game as a set of actions that are directed towards a goal, that would be playing house, this fantasy which is practice, but doing it so it's fun. You find someone that you can do that with, that's fun, then you want to do that repeatedly, and that's a friendship. You're a friend with someone that you can play repeated games with, and so that's a set of games. A friend is someone you can play a set of games with. 

皮亚杰精彩地指出，这实际上是社会秩序本身的基础，这是孩子们想玩游戏的部分原因，因为他们在练习做成年人。我们随着成长玩越来越复杂和包容的游戏，也许这并不总是有趣，但如果你擅长自己做的事情，你可以赋予它游戏的精神。那么有趣的是什么呢?

Piaget pointed out brilliantly that that's really the foundation of social order itself, and that's part of the reason children want to play games, because they're practicing being adults. We play more and more complex and inclusive games as we mature, and maybe that's not always fun, but if you're good at what you do, you can imbue it with that spirit of play. And so then what's so interesting about that is that?

理智和社会秩序开始变成更像是一个复杂层级系统的涌现属性。这是一种理解它的方法。想象一下，这是20世纪30年代。你出去约会，你打扮得体，把你的女友带到当地的夜总会，有一个摇摆乐队在演奏。他们在做什么？他们在那里发出模式，和声模式，这些模式是分层的，并朝着一个目标，那就是旋律。旋律结束时你能感觉到它的结束。它有一个开始和一个结束，中间有高潮。这是一个故事。为什么人们被它吸引？原因是因为世界是由模式组成的，而音乐模仿了世界。当世界以最佳状态展开时，它由和谐互动的模式组成，而这就是音乐所呈现的。音乐家在演奏，因为他们在展示这些他们知道的模式，但他们在扭曲它们，玩弄它们，享受其中的乐趣，所以乐队在跳舞。然后你邀请你喜欢的女孩起舞。你在跳舞时做什么？你在协调你的身体与音乐家们创造的模式，然后你回应你的约会对象表现出的动作模式。希望你能以一种玩乐的方式进行，并且在15秒内能保持手脚干净，表明你有一定的自控能力，甚至还有些许的优雅。你们一起玩，还有其他人在同一时间做同样的事情，大家都玩得很开心。他们是理智的。

Sanity and social order start to become something that's more like an emergent property of a complex hierarchical system. So here's a way of understanding it. Imagine it's the 1930s. You're out on a date, and you get dressed up and you bring your girlfriend out to the local cabaret, and there's a swing band playing. What are they doing? They're up there emitting patterns, harmonic patterns, and the patterns are layered and oriented towards a goal, and that's the melody. A melody ends, and you can tell when it ends. It has a beginning and an end and a climax in the middle. It's a story. Why are people attracted to that? The reason is because the world's made out of patterns, and music mimics the world. When the world is laying itself out optimally, it's made of harmoniously interacting patterns, and that's what music presents. The musicians are playing because they're laying out these patterns that they know, but they're twisting them and bending them and having fun with them, and so the band is hopping. Then you ask the girl that you're attracted to to get up and dance. What are you doing when you're dancing? You're aligning your body with the patterns the musicians are making, and then you're doing that in response to the patterns of movement that your date is manifesting. And hopefully you do that playfully, and you can keep your bloody hands to yourself for like 15 seconds, indicating that you have some capacity for self-control and maybe a modicum of grace. You play together doing that, and there's a bunch of other people doing it at the same time, and everyone's having a great time. They're sane.

为什么？因为他们同时与周围的人团结一致。他们彼此团结，他们内部团结，他们与世界的模式团结一致。都是同时发生的。这不是个人主义。这就像当你被音乐感染时发生的事情。它部分是内部的，但也部分是你与世界结构的和谐。

Why? It's because they're simultaneously united with the people around them. They're united with each other, they're united internally, and they're united with the patterns of the world, all at the same time. All at the same time. Well, that's not individuality. It's the same thing that happens to you when you're swept along with the music. It's partly internal, but it's partly the concordance between you and the structure of the world. 

这有点像保守派和自由派观点的混合，因为你当然是作为一个个体存在的，这是自由派的观点。但是，作为一个完全与社会层级分离的个体，你只是一个精神错乱的孤独者。你需要一个伙伴，你需要一个家庭，你需要朋友，你需要一份工作或事业，你需要在教育方面有所追求，你需要承担一些公民责任，而所有这些的和谐互动构成了你的理智。

That's kind of like an amalgam of a conservative and a liberal viewpoint, because of course you're there as an individual, so that'd be the liberal viewpoint. But then as an individual detached entirely from the hierarchy of society, well, you're just a deranged loner. You have to have a partner, you have to have a family, you have to have friends, you have to have a job or a career, you have to be pursuing something on the educational front, you have to have some civic responsibility, and it's the harmonious interaction of all of that that constitutes your sanity.

因为也许你很完整，但你的孩子有麻烦。你是理智的吗？不是。怎么说来着？你只和你最悲惨的孩子一样快乐。那是因为你的理智不在你内部；它是你和现实之间和谐的反映。我想你可以说最高的宗教实践是发展这种和谐。集体主义者不会打败个人主义者，因为你不是集体主义者，但个人主义者不会打败集体主义者，因为你不是一个孤立的个体。那些将胜利的人——这是永恒的真理——是那些正确地形成这些责任层级，中介责任层级，并负责任地将自己放入这些结构中的人。

Because maybe you're pretty well put together, and then your kid is having trouble. Are you saying it's like, no, what's the saying? You're only as happy as your most miserable kid. That's because your sanity isn't inside you; it's a reflection of the concordance between you and reality itself. I suppose you might say that the highest of religious practices is to develop that concordance. The collectivist won't beat the individualist because you're not the collective, but the individualist won't beat the collectivist because you're not just a deracinated individual. The people who will win—this is the eternal truth—are the people who formulate these hierarchies of responsibility, intermediary hierarchies of responsibility properly, and slot themselves responsibly within those structures.

这使你成为一个负责任的公民。也许你是一个志愿消防员。这就是你善良与世界实际结构之间和谐的例子。这是真正主权的所在。如果你观看《出埃及记》研讨会，我在第一次出来时谈到过的，有一个关于这个问题的大讨论贯穿整个研讨会。《出埃及记》故事中发生的是，以色列人在沙漠中试图组织自己，他们试图提升摩西成为法老的形象。摩西被诱惑，因为他们希望他成为最高法官，他们不想承担任何责任。摩西的岳父，叶忒罗，来了，说：“你不能这样做。你不能成为新的法老。这对你不好；这会让你筋疲力尽，对人们也不好。”他说他们必须分层组织自己。他说，“把他们分成十人一组。让这十人选举一个长者。长者中让他们选一个元长者。一直这样做，直到你有成千上万的组。让每一级都有自己的责任。如果问题在底层出现，应在当地解决。任何不能由层级解决的问题可以提交给你，但每一层级都应该有自己的责任。你应该是一个负责任的个体，有一个负责任的家庭，一个负责任的企业，一个负责任的社区，一直到国家或国际层级。你的参与就是你的真正主权责任，这是一个与沙漠混乱和埃及暴政相比稳定的状态。”

That makes you a responsible citizen. Maybe you're a volunteer firefighter. That's an example of that concordance between your goodness and the actual structures of the world. That's where genuine sovereignty lies. If you watch the Exodus seminar, which I talked about when I first came out, there's a massive discussion about exactly this that runs through the seminar. What happens in the Exodus story is that the Israelites are trying to figure out how to organize themselves in the desert, and they try to elevate Moses to the figure of Pharaoh essentially. Moses is tempted to do it because they want him to be the ultimate judge, and they don't want any responsibility. Moses's father-in-law, Jethro, comes along and says, "You can't do that. You can't be the new Pharaoh. It's not good for you; it'll exhaust you, and it's not good for the people." He tells them they have to organize themselves hierarchically. He says, "Break them into groups of 10. Have the 10 elect an elder. The elders have them elect a meta-elder. Keep doing that all the way up the hierarchy until you have groups of 10,000. Let each level adopt its own responsibility. If problems arise at the bottom, they should be settled locally. Any problem that can't be settled by the hierarchy can get referred to you, but every bit of the hierarchy should have its level of responsibility. You should be a responsible individual, have a responsible family, and a responsible business, and a responsible community, and so forth, all the way up to the national or international level. Your participation in that is your true sovereign responsibility, and that's a state that's stable in comparison to the chaos of the desert and the tyranny of Egypt."

#### 你能定义一下你所称的“德勤式道德家”的人群以及他们造成的主要问题吗？你有什么解决方案吗？

你能定义一下你所称的“德勤式道德家”的人群以及他们造成的主要问题吗？你有什么解决方案吗？这有一个值得思考的经验法则。第一个问题可能是，“末日将至吗？”答案是，“是的，一直如此。”人们一直这样认为，你可能会问为什么。答案是，“嗯，明天可能会发生灾难来摧毁你，最终它肯定会在个人层面发生，因为你会死，这非常末日。但是可能会更糟。”灾难总是在逼近。人们有一个大问题：在灾难逼近时如何行动？

Could you define the group of people you have coined the "Deloitte-style moralists" and what major issues they're causing? What solutions do you propose? Here's a rule of thumb for you to think about. The first question might be, "Is the apocalypse nigh?" The answer is, "Yeah, all the time." People have thought that way forever, and you might ask why. The answer is, "Well, something cataclysmic could happen tomorrow to take you out, and eventually it will certainly happen personally because you're going to die, and that's pretty apocalyptic. But it could be way worse than that." There's always a catastrophe looming. People have a big problem: how do you act when there's a catastrophe looming? 

谁应该在灾难逼近时领导你？我有一些经验法则。如果声称是领导者的人因为恐惧而瘫痪，他们就太弱小了，无法应对那条龙。如果他们被诱惑去使用强制手段进行暴政，他们就是错误的领导者。如果他们利用末日的威胁来要求获得所有的权力，他们就是末日。这些都是经验法则。如果你是临床医生，有人面临危机，他们通常会因为恐惧而瘫痪，并倾向于暴政。也许他们在家里很生气，欺负每个人，但他们也很害怕。所以你知道他们面临的危机对他们来说太大了。你知道这是因为他们自己的神经系统告诉他们。“不要靠近那条龙。它会把你烧成灰烬。”那么你对这样的人怎么办？你帮助他们把龙分解成更小的蜥蜴。你不断缩小龙的大小，直到蜥蜴大到他们可以踩踏。

That's where you start thinking about it and here's another question, who should lead you when a catastrophe is looming? I've got some rules of thumb. If the person who claims to be a leader is frightened into paralysis, they're too small for that dragon. If they're enticed into a tyranny that uses compulsion, they're the wrong leaders. If they use the threat of the apocalypse to claim access to all the power, they're the apocalypse. Those are rules of thumb. If you're a clinician and someone is facing a crisis, they're often frightened into paralysis and tempted towards tyranny. Maybe they're angry at home and bullying everybody, but they're also scared. So you know that the crisis they're facing is too big for them. You know that because their own nervous systems are telling them that. They're saying, "Don't go near that dragon. It will definitely burn you to a crisp." So what do you do with people like that? You help them cut the dragon down into smaller lizards. You keep cutting the dragon down until the lizard is big enough so they can step on it.

这实际上意味着什么？也许你有一个人被工作上的暴政压迫，他们讨厌这份工作，但他们害怕进入就业市场，因为他们的简历不整齐。他们甚至不敢打开包含简历的电脑文件，因为他们太害怕看它——这是他们过去所有失败的记录。所以，你注意到了，你与他们讨论，你说，“好吧，难怪你害怕这样做。你不知道如何在面试中表现自己，也不想在求职时被拒绝。只需坐在电脑前，打开你的简历，看看第一页。就这样。不要动它，不要修改它，或者只是打开文件夹，然后下周再来。”有时人们会回来，说，“我做不到。”然后你说，“好吧，看，坐在那里，闭上眼睛。现在放松一下。想象你坐在电脑前。尽量生动地想象。想象你在浏览文件夹，点击写着简历的文件夹。打开它，你看到你的简历。生动地呈现这一点。”通常，人们能做到这一点。如果你能让他们想象，那他们实际做的可能性就更大。你不断缩小问题，直到他们不再是害怕的暴君。然后，你可以帮助人们进步。

What does that mean practically? Maybe you have someone who's being tyrannized at work and they hate the job, but they're afraid to go on the job market because their CV is in disorder. They won't even open the computer file that contains their resume because they're too terrified to look at it—it's a record of all their past failures. So, you note that, you talk them through it, you say, "Okay, look, no wonder you're afraid to do this. You don't know how to conduct yourself in an interview, and you don't want to be rejected when you go out on a job search. Just sit down at your computer and open your CV and look at the first page. That's it. Don't touch it, don't modify it, or maybe just open the folder, and then come back next week." Sometimes people will come back and say, "I couldn't do it." And then what you do is you say, "Okay, look, just sit there, close your eyes. Like, relax a bit now. Just imagine you're sitting at your computer. Like, imagine it as vividly as you can. Imagine you're going through your file folders, and you click on the one that says resumes. You open it, and you see your resume. Make that vivid." And usually, people can do that. And if you can get them to imagine it, then there's a higher chance that they'll actually do it. And you just keep shrinking the problem until they're no longer a frightened tyrant. And then, you can help people progress.

但这是一个实际问题，事实是，你自己的神经系统为你校准龙的大小。所以，如果你变成了一个害怕的暴君，那么你不是合适的人选。当你看到前面的人在说，“天啊，天塌下来了，我们都会死，我应该拥有所有的权力。”那就是“你不是合适的人选，伙计。”真的，你不是。甚至你自己都知道。如果你连自己都不能说服，因为你不能控制你的恐惧和你的暴政倾向，为什么世界上的任何人都应该信任你？

But that's a practical issue, the reality of the situation is that your own nervous system calibrates dragon size for you. And so, if you're turned into a frightened tyrant, then you're not the person for the job. When you look around in front of you and see people going, "Oh my God, the sky is falling, we're all going to die, and I should have all the power," it's like, "No, you're not the right guy, buddy." Really, you're not. Even you know that. So, if you can't even convince yourself because you can't take control of your terror and your proclivity to tyranny, why in the world should anyone else trust you?

这非常有用的知识。知道我们一直面临末日的威胁也是有用的。这是作为人类的一部分，因为世界随时可能打开并吞噬你，不仅是你，还有你的整个文化。这种情况一直发生，我们必须与之共处。然后你可能会问，“谁引导你度过这一切？”答案是，我会告诉你一些很酷的东西，然后我们就此结束，因为这很酷。我在《出埃及记》研讨会上从乔纳森·佩格那里学到这一点，非常聪明。

That's really useful to know. And it's also useful to know that we've always faced the threat of the apocalypse. It's part and parcel of being human because the world can open up and swallow you at any moment, and not just you but your whole culture. It happens all the time, and we have to live with that. Then you might say, "Who guides you through that?" And the answer is, I'll tell you something cool, and then we'll close with this, because this is cool. I learned this in this Exodus seminar from Jonathan Pajo. So brilliant.

以色列人在沙漠中，他们逃离了暴政，这非常棒。我们不再被暴政压迫了。就像，“不，这不太好。我们理解的一切都崩溃了，现在我们在沙漠中。”什么是沙漠？很难找到水，很难找到食物，我们是奴隶，所以我们不知道如何组织自己，我们不知道该去哪个方向，所以我们都焦虑和困惑。沙漠中的情况非常惨淡，我们在哀求回到暴政。这就是人类，确实如此。

So the Israelites are out there in the desert. They've escaped from tyranny, and that's pretty great. We're no longer being tyrannized. It's like, "Nah, it's not so great. Everything we understood collapsed, and now we're in the desert." And what's the desert? It's hard to get water, it's hard to get food, we're slaves, so we don't know how to organize ourselves, and we don't know what direction to go, so we're all anxious and confused. It's so bloody dismal in the desert that we're whining to return to the tyranny. That's human beings, man, that's for sure.

现在以色列人在沙漠中迷失了，你也会在某个时候迷失在沙漠中。也许你现在就在沙漠中迷失了。你不知道该去哪个方向，你焦虑，容易崇拜虚假的偶像，怨天尤人，希望有个王来拯救你。但你在沙漠中。那么问题是，是什么引导你穿越沙漠？这是你需要回答的问题。

Now the Israelites are lost in the desert, and you're going to be lost in the desert at some point. Maybe you're lost in the desert right now. You don't know what direction to go, and you're anxious and prone to worship false idols and whiny and resentful and hoping a king will come and save you. But you're in the desert. So then the question is, what guides you through the desert? Now there's a question you need to have answered.


在《出埃及记》故事中，上帝在夜间以火柱和白天以云柱的形式出现。你想，“这可能是什么意思？”佩格说这意味着和道家的阴阳一样的东西。道家认为世界是由混沌和秩序构成的。道家的象征，著名的阴阳象征，是两条蛇——一条黑蛇和一条白蛇——首尾相连。这就是世界。它意味着世界是由混沌和秩序构成的。混沌是你不了解的东西。混沌是仍可能显现的东西。混沌是未揭示的未来。秩序是当事情按照你的计划进行时你所在的地方。

So what happens in the Exodus story is that God appears as a pillar of fire at night and a pillar of cloud during the day. You think, "What in the world could that possibly mean?" Pajo said it means the same thing as the Taoist yin and yang. The Taoists believe that the world is made out of chaos and order. The Taoist symbol, the famous yin and yang symbol, is two serpents—a black serpent and a white serpent—tail to nose. That's the world. It means the world's made out of chaos and order. Chaos is what you don't understand. Chaos is what still might make itself manifest. Chaos is the unrevealed future. Order is the place you are when things are going according to your plan.

你的大脑半球也是这样设置的。左半球主要处理秩序领域，右半球主要处理混沌领域。所以这是真实的。道家说你必须与混沌和秩序的内在交互斗争，与你知道的和你不知道的斗争，与可能性和现实斗争。你如何与之斗争？他们还指出，在每一个混沌领域中，那是黑蛇，有一个白点。这意味着任何混沌的东西都可以变得有序。你知道这是真的，因为你可能会陷入混乱和困惑。然后你找到了解决方案，一切变得井然有序。这就是秩序如何从混沌中显现出来。反过来也是真实的：事情可以在秩序领域中顺利进行，然后一切陷入混乱。

Your hemispheres are even set up that way in your brain. The left hemisphere basically deals with the realm of order, and the right hemisphere basically deals with the realm of chaos. So this is real. The Taoists say you have to contend with the internal interplay of chaos and order, with what you know and what you don't know, with possibility and actuality. How do you contend with that? They also point out that within every chaotic domain, that's the black serpent, there's a white dot. That means anything chaotic can become orderly. That's true because you can be in disarray and confused, and then you get the solution and everything comes together. That's how order can manifest itself out of chaos. The reverse is also true: things can be going along perfectly well in the domain of order, and then all hell breaks loose.

这就是人类的永恒处境。这就是世界。道家说你需要走在混沌和秩序之间的线条上。这意味着什么？你可以存在主义地理解这一点。这就是你玩游戏时在做的事情。想象一下你在与某人一对一篮球比赛。现在想象一下你想要什么样的对手。想象你只是想赢，因为当然，你想赢，因为你在玩一对一篮球比赛。现在你可以选择你的对手。你是七英尺六英寸高或八英尺二英寸高，你只需把篮球放进篮筐里。你想要与一个三英尺高的人比赛，为什么？因为你可以轻松击败他。你会赢得那场比赛，但没有人选择那个人作为对手。你可能会问为什么。因为你肯定会赢。所以，如果你只是想赢得比赛，为什么不选择一个你可以轻松击败的人？答案是，因为那不公平。那是一个答案。那不有趣。那是一个更好的答案。

So that's the eternal situation of human beings. That's the world. The Taoists say you need to walk the line between chaos and order. What does that mean? You can understand this existentially. This is what you're doing when you're playing a game. Imagine you're playing one-on-one basketball with someone. Now think about who you want as an opponent. Imagine you just want to win because, of course, you want to win because you're playing one-on-one basketball. So now you get to pick your opponent. You're like seven foot six or eight foot two, and you just drop the basketball right through the hoop. You want to play someone who's three feet tall and two feet high. Why? Because you can just stomp them. You're going to win that game for sure. But no one picks that person as an opponent. You might ask why. Because you're assured of victory. So if you're just trying to win the game, why not pick someone you can just crush? The answer is, well, that's not fair. That's one answer. That's not any fun. That's a better answer.

那么什么是有趣的？什么是最有趣的游戏？你找到了一个大约与你一样优秀的对手。或者也许你找到了一个比你稍微好一点的对手。这意味着实际上你倾向于失败，除非你出色发挥。那么你可能会想，这是一个很棒的游戏。一个很棒的游戏是你在玩可能赢的游戏，但迫使你在玩的过程中变得更好。为什么这是一个很棒的游戏？嗯，你可能会赢，这是一个好处，但你也会变得更好。你尽力去赢。

So what's fun? What's optimal fun? You find an opponent who is about as good as you are. Or maybe you find an opponent who's just a little better than you. That means actually you're tilted towards failure unless you excel. Then you might think, here's a great game. A great game is a game that you're playing that you could possibly win but that forces you to get better while you're playing. Why is that a great game? Well, you get to maybe win, so that's a good deal, but you get to get better. You're trying to win.

这就是当你告诉孩子在玩游戏时要做一个好运动员时所做的事情。输赢无关紧要；重要的是你如何玩游戏。为什么？因为最好的游戏是让你在玩的过程中变得更好的游戏。你有可能赢的合理机会。这样的游戏是什么？它是引人入胜的。它是玩。它是最佳挑战。它正是混沌和秩序之间的平衡。你有一只脚在秩序中——你知道怎么玩游戏——但你有一只脚在混沌中，因为你被推到了极限，那就是意义的所在。

Well, that's what you do when you tell a kid to be a good sport when they're playing a game. It doesn't matter whether you win or lose; it's how you play the game. Why? Because the best game is one that stretches you to get better. You have a reasonable chance of winning. What is a game like that? It's engrossing. It's play. It's optimal challenge. It's exactly the balance between chaos and order. You've got one foot in order—you can play the game, you know—but you've got one foot in chaos because you're being pushed to your limit, and that's where the meaning is.

这就是夜间火柱和白天云柱的表现形式。它与道家的愿景完全相同。佩格告诉我这个故事后，我有了一个三天的愿景，看到这种巨大的东方文化与这个古老的犹太故事的结合。我可以看到这个巨大的符号，这个阴阳符号，降临在以色列的沙漠上，为以色列人指引路径，他们的马车和牛群以及其他牲畜，他们在沙漠中穿行，通过仔细观察混乱和秩序的相互作用，并在前进的过程中找出最有意义的东西。这太聪明了。

Well, that's the manifestation of the pillar of fire at night and the pillar of cloud during the day. It's exactly the same vision as the Taoists. After Pajo told me that story, I had this vision for like three days of this huge conjunction of Eastern culture with this ancient Jewish story. I could see this huge symbol, this yin and yang symbol, descend onto the desert in Israel and lay out the path for the Israelites with their carts and their oxen and the rest of their livestock, weaving their way through the desert by carefully attending to the interplay of chaos and order and feeling out what was most meaningful as they progressed. It's so brilliant.

这就是你前进时的指导。这是一个很好的知识：那种动态游戏的精神和随之而来的参与感。这是一种最高的统一精神的表现，心理上和社会上。它深深地植根于你的内部，不仅是神学上，而且是生物学上最深层次的，那种引导你进一步发展的本能。那是最好的指导。

That's what guides you as you move along. That's such a good thing to know: that spirit of dynamic play and the engaged meaning that comes along with that. That's a manifestation of the highest uniting spirit, psychologically and socially. It's built into you, not only theologically but biologically at the deepest possible level, that instinct that orients you to further development. That is the best guide.

你需要一个鼓励你这样做的领导者，对吧？不是告诉你该做什么。你不想放弃那种责任。你想被邀请一起玩。这就是解决方案。承担你的责任。这是你生活中所有意义的所在。把你的家庭组织好。为你的事业做点什么。参与社会事务。承担那种责任。如果你擅长，你可以以这种动态的方式做到，这会让你不断超越自己。这会让你的生活充满意义，这是对痛苦的解药。你会在你生活的冒险中找到那种感觉。这远远好于只是快乐，或只是安全，或只是安心。谁想要安全呢？

You want a leader who encourages that in you, right? Who doesn't tell you what to do. You don't want to abdicate that responsibility. You want to be invited along to play. Well, that's the solution. Take on your responsibility. That's where all the meaning is in your life. Get your family together. Do something for your business. Get engaged civically. Take on that responsibility. If you're good at it, you can do it in this dynamic way that makes you more than you are all the time. That'll imbue your life with meaning, and that's the antidote to suffering. You find that in the adventure of your life. That's way better than just happy, or just secure, or just safe. Who the hell wants to be safe?


一旦你安全了，你就会陷入睡眠。睡眠实际上是对没有什么事情可做的反应。你甚至不需要意识。所以你不想要安全；你想要在你生命的光辉冒险中。那是怎么标记的？那就是最佳挑战。

As soon as you're safe, you just fall asleep. Sleep is actually a response to the fact that there's nothing for you to do. You don't even have to be conscious. So you don't want to be safe; you want to be on the glorious adventure of your life. How is that marked? It's like optimal challenge.

夏娃这个词，夏娃是由亚当的肋骨造的。有一种观点认为，原始的人类，那个完美的人类，居住在天堂里，既是男性也是女性，然后被撕裂开来，所以他们不断试图重新结合。那种重新结合是如何表现出来的？希伯来词夏娃的意思是有益的对手。这意味着什么？它意味着在这种最严肃形式的游戏中的伙伴。什么是最严肃的游戏形式？性游戏肯定是最严肃的游戏形式之一，但如果运作良好的亲密关系中的游戏部分，是持续的、优化的对抗性战斗。

The word Eve, you know, Eve is made out of Adam's rib. There's an idea that the original human being, the perfect human being that inhabited paradise, was both male and female and then torn apart, and so trying to come back together constantly. How does that coming together make itself manifest? The word Eve, the Hebrew word Eve, means beneficial adversary. What does that mean? It means partner in this most serious form of play. What's the most serious form of play? Sexual play is certainly one of the most serious forms of play, but the play that is part and parcel of an intimate relationship is, if it's working properly, constant, optimized, adversarial combat.

就像，你的妻子认为你应该比现在更好，反之亦然。如果有太多的判断，这会变成一种沉重的负担。但是如果是优化的沟通，那就是启发性的游戏。这引人入胜且有趣，是爱情的一部分。部分原因是你应该被推动去扩展。当然，你的妻子应该希望你这样，因为风暴即将来临，你应该做好准备。我说过，我知道这可能成为一种沉重的负担，就像任何理想都可能成为负担。但如果是优化的，那么没有什么比这更重要，你也不应该希望有其他东西，没有什么对你更好。

It's like, your wife thinks you should be better than you are, and vice versa. That can become a crushing weight if it's accompanied by too much judgment. But if it's optimized communication, then it's provocative play. That's engrossing and entertaining and part and parcel of love. Part of the reason for that is that you should be impelled to expand. Of course, your wife should want that of you because the storms are coming, and you should be prepared. As I said, I know that can become a crushing burden, like any ideal can become a burden. But if it's optimized, then there isn't anything you want more than that, and there isn't anything you should want, and there isn't anything that's better for you.

我们真正想要的是被推到我们的能力边缘，迫使我们成为比现在更好的自己。被诱导自愿接受成为比现在更好的命运——那是生活的地方。那是最大意义的地方。那是在瞬间对悲剧的防御，因为现在是有意义的，但也在未来，因为你实际上变得比现在更好。那是什么？那是生命的秘密。对，那是生命的秘密。

What we all really want is to be put on the edge of our capacity and forced to become more than we currently are. Enticed to voluntarily accept the destiny of becoming more than what we currently are—that's the place to live. That's the place of maximal meaning. That's fortification against tragedy right in the moment because now it's meaningful but also in the future because you are in fact becoming more than you are. So what's that? That's the secret to life, man. Yeah, that's the secret to life.

好了，各位。非常感谢大家。很高兴与你们交谈。谢谢，我亲爱的。很高兴见到你们。谢谢。

All right, everyone. Thank you very much. Very good to talk to all of you. Thank you, my dear. Good to see you all. Thank you.
