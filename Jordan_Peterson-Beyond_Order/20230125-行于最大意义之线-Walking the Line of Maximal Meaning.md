## 行于最大意义之线

Walking the Line of Maximal Meaning

### 廉价能源

谢谢大家。很高兴见到你们。非常感谢你们今晚的到来。我会尝试将我在多伦多大学和哈佛大学讲课时通常需要大约10小时的内容压缩到45或50分钟。让我们看看能不能做到。所以，我最近和一位名叫亚历克斯·爱泼斯坦的作者聊了聊，亚历克斯写了一本书，书名叫《化石燃料的未来》，可能会让他惹上大麻烦。我最近采访了很多人，可以说主要是科学家，他们大多否认气候变化，尽管普遍接受目前确实有一定程度的变暖，但他们并不认为这会导致世界末日。

Thank you. Good to see you all. Thank you all very much for coming tonight. I'm going to try to condense what usually took me about 10 hours when I was lecturing at the University of Toronto and at Harvard into about 45 or 50 minutes. I'll see if we can do it. So I was talking recently with an author named Alex Epstein, and Alex wrote a book which should probably get him shot, called "Fossil Fuel Future." I've interviewed a lot of people recently who are climate change deniers, let's say scientists mostly, who are generally accepting of the prognosis that there's a certain amount of warming going on at the moment, certainly not convinced that the consequence of that is apocalyptic. 

我们是否更危险，这个问题尚未有定论，来自于我们工业转型的意外后果，还是来自于末日预言所引发的彻底恐慌式暴政，尤其是这种说法：既然世界末日即将来临，那么我应该掌握所有的权力，这种说法我不得不认为太过便利且可能极其危险。我与很多人谈过所谓的气候变化，像比约恩·隆伯格、麻省理工学院的理查德·林岑和史蒂夫·库宁等，还有朱迪斯·库里，这些人非常了解情况，非常有能力，非常谨慎。而爱泼斯坦有些不同，他在某些方面更为极端，因为他非常直率地论证了使用化石燃料不仅是必要的，而且是有用且道德的，因为与木材或粪便相比，化石燃料提供了一种可靠且相对清洁、廉价的替代能源或一般能源。

It's an open question whether we're more in danger from the unintended consequences of our industrial transformation, let's say, or the utter panicked tyranny that apocalyptic doomsaying seems to produce, especially in alignment with the claim that since the apocalypse is nigh then I should have all the power, and that's a claim that I can't help but regard as a little too convenient and of likely exceptional danger. Now I've spoken with lots of people about so-called climate change, people like Bjorn Lomborg and Richard Lindzen from MIT and Steve Koonin, etc., Judith Currie, very informed people, very competent, careful people. Epstein's a little different, he's a little more extreme in some ways because he's making a very forthright case for not only the necessity but the utility and the morality of using fossil fuels insofar as they provide a reliable and comparatively clean, say compared to wood or dung, clean and an inexpensive alternative energy source or energy source in general. 

当然，道德层面的论点是，没有什么比廉价能源与消除绝对贫困更紧密相关。因此，你可以非常有力地论证，如果你从事提供廉价、可靠的能源（的行业），那么从原则上讲，你是在做一些非常积极的事情，因为你在帮助人们摆脱绝对贫困。那些绝对贫困的人，他们会死亡，他们的孩子没有受教育的机会，他们的生长和智力发育受到阻碍。

And the moral case, of course, is that there isn't anything more tightly linked to the remediation of absolute poverty than inexpensive energy. And so you can make a very solid case that if you're in the business of providing inexpensive, reliable energy, then you're doing something that could in principle be very positive because you're helping people escape from absolute poverty. People who are absolutely poor enough, well, they die, and their children have no educational opportunities and they're stunted in their growth and their intellectual development. 

不仅如此，他们对生存采取短期的视角，因为如果你不知道下一顿饭从哪里来，你就会这样做。有大量证据表明，如果你能让人们变得足够富有——事实证明，临界点是人均国内生产总值约五千美元——如果你能让人们变得足够富有，他们会开始对环境的维护产生浓厚的兴趣。原因是他们从直接关心的灾难中解脱出来，可以思考他们将给子孙后代留下什么样的地球。但是，当你还在泥土中翻找，努力寻找干净的水源和合理的卫生设施以及下一顿饭时，你并没有这个余地。

And not only that, they take a short term view of their survival, because that's what you do if you're not sure where you're going to get your next meal, let's say, and there's plenty of evidence that suggests that if you can get people rich enough—turns out the tipping point is about five thousand dollars a year in per capita gross domestic product—if you can get people rich enough, they start to take an intense interest in the maintenance of the environment, and the reason for that is they're freed enough from the catastrophes of immediate concern so that they can think about what sort of planet they would leave their children or even their grandchildren. But you don't really have that luxury until you're not scrabbling around in the dirt,  trying to find fresh water and reasonable access to sanitation facilities and your next meal. 

因此，我认为，正如亚历克斯所做的那样，你可以强有力地论证，我们都有责任尽力消除获得充足、廉价、可靠能源的障碍，尤其是对那些处于绝对贫困状态的人们。实际上，在过去六十年里，我们在这方面做得非常出色。

And so it's pretty obvious, I think, that you can make a strong case with, as Alex does, that it's incumbent upon us all to do what we can to at least eliminate the barriers to access to plentiful, inexpensive, reliable energy, especially to people who are absolutely in states of absolute privation. We've actually done a stellar job of that in the last six decades, let's say. 

地球的人口从三十五亿增加到现在的八十亿。与此同时，我们以前所未有的数量使人们摆脱了贫困，甚至减少了处于极度贫困中的人们的绝对数量。所以，这一切都很好。现在，爱泼斯坦提出了一个额外的论点，我觉得非常有趣，因为它与我写第一本书《意义的地图》时得出的结论相吻合。

Well, the population of the earth has increased from three and a half billion to its current eight billion. We've simultaneously lifted people out of poverty in numbers undreamed of in ages previously, and also even reduced the absolute number of people in dire poverty so that's all well and good now Epstein makes an additional argument which I found very interesting because it dovetailed with a conclusion I drew when I wrote my first book called "Maps of Meaning." 

### 价值层次

我在《意义的地图》中试图做的是，正如书名所示，描绘我们看待世界的隐含结构的分析，这是一个很好的思考方式。你不能关注世界上的所有事物，因为要关注的东西太多了，所以你必须选择——或者说你内心的某些东西在选择——你关注什么。你几乎不关注任何事情，你忽略了几乎所有事情，然后对某些事情比其他事情更多关注，比如你更关注你所爱的人，如果你对爱有效的话，至少你是这样做的。这意味着这些人对你更重要，这意味着你更重视他们。所有这些都暗示着，你通过一个注意力优先级的层次来看待世界，本质上是一个价值层次，这是不可避免的。

What I tried to do in "Maps of Meaning," and that's the reason it's titled "Maps of Meaning," is to lay out an analysis of the implicit structure through which we view the world. That's a good way of thinking about it. You can't pay attention to everything in the world; there are too many things to pay attention to, so you have to choose—or something within you chooses—what you pay attention to. There's hardly anything you pay attention to; you ignore almost everything. And then, some things you pay more attention to than others, like you pay more attention to people you love. It's in all likelihood if you're effective in your love, at least that's what you do. And that means those people are more important to you, and that means you value them more. And what that implies, all of that, is that you view the world through a hierarchy of attentional priority, a hierarchy of value essentially. And that's inevitable.

在解决感知问题时，无法避免建立一个价值层次。当我在研究这个想法时，我意识到——这本书出版于1999年，但我已经研究了大约15年——对价值层次的描述就是一个故事。这就是故事的本质。这个发现对我非常有用，因为我一直很好奇，为什么我们对故事如此着迷，例如，为什么故事对我们来说如此本质上有意义。很容易将我们对叙事的迷恋仅仅视为对娱乐的易感性，但这就引出了一个问题，对吧？问题是，为什么你觉得它有娱乐性？

You can't solve the problem of perception without the establishment of a hierarchy of value. And I realized when I was working through that idea— I published this book in 1999 but had worked on it for about 15 years—that the description of a hierarchy of value was a story. That's what a story is. That was real useful to me because I was very curious about why we're so captured by stories, for example, why they're so intrinsically meaningful to us. It's easy just to dismiss our proclivity to be enraptured by narrative as nothing but our susceptibility to entertainment, but it begs the question, right? The question is, well, why do you find it entertaining?

这并不是显而易见的。难道我们真的如此愚蠢，以至于认为我们觉得某些事物有趣只是因为我们倾向于琐碎和寻求轻松愉快的时光？有时候你去看一部电影，它只是一段轻松的故事，你也知道这一点。也许你在工作上度过了艰难的一天，不想进行深入的思考，这也无可厚非。但并不是说人们不能坐下来观看一部严肃的戏剧，一部深深打动他们的戏剧，一部甚至可能让他们经历各种强烈的负面情绪的戏剧，这也是一个谜。你知道，它让他们面对恐惧、强烈的戏剧、失败的爱情或悲剧性的结局。我们在虚构的世界中让自己体验到完整的人类情感，这样做是完全合理的，那么为什么我们要这样做呢？

It's not like that is self-evident. Are we really all that foolish to assume that the reason we find things entertaining is merely because we're oriented towards the trivial and seek a light-hearted good time? Sometimes you go see a movie, and it's just a piece of fluff, and you know it. Maybe you had a hard day at work and don't want to think deeply, and fair enough. But it's not like people are incapable of sitting down and watching a serious drama, one that moves them deeply, one that might even run them through a variety of intense states of negative emotion—quite the mystery as well. You know, it confronts them with horror, intense drama, romance gone bad, or tragic outcomes. We expose ourselves to the full human experience in the world of fiction, and it's a perfectly reasonable question to ask why we do that.

我们通过虚构的表现来获取存在的模式、感知的模式和行动的模式，这些模式可以帮助我们在世界中找到方向。知道这一点后，你还可以假设叙事中存在某种深度层次的层次结构。有一些浅显的故事，比如廉价的动作冒险电影或浪漫小说——表层的约会之夜浪漫故事。

We engage in fictional representations to derive patterns of existence, patterns of perception, and action that can help orient us in the world. And knowing that, you can also hypothesize the existence of something like a hierarchy of depth in narrative. There are shallow stories, like cheap action-adventure movies or Harlequin romance novels—surface-level date night romances.

我并不是对此表示轻蔑；我只是指出，我们很清楚有一些浅显的故事，但我们也同样清楚，每个人都知道这一点，这很奇怪，我们知道有些故事是深刻的。你去看一部电影或一场戏剧，你看到一个深刻的故事，你观看一个深刻的故事，你听到一个深刻的故事，它会打动你。无论这意味着什么——它打动你是什么意思？你知道，它可能会让你流泪。为什么用这个比喻？为什么说“打动”？为什么说“深刻”？

I'm not being contemptuous of that; I'm just pointing out that we know perfectly well there are some shallow stories, but we also know, and everyone knows this, it's very strange that we know this, that there are deep stories. You go to a movie or a play, and you see a deep story, you watch a deep story, you hear a deep story, and it moves you. Whatever that means—what does it mean, it moves you? You know, it might move you to tears. Why that metaphor? Why "move"? Why "deep"? 

答案是，它改变了你用来构建世界的假设，如果这是一次深刻的体验，它会改变你用来构建世界的深层假设。而这些深层假设恰恰是许多其他假设所依赖的基础。这就是深度的定义。

The answer is, well, it changes you. It changes the presumptions you use to structure the world, and it changes the deep presumptions that you use if it's a deep experience. And the deep presumptions are precisely those presumptions upon which many other presumptions depend. That's a definition of depth.

例如，如果你离婚了，通常会感到深深的痛苦，原因是，基本上，尤其是在离婚让你措手不及的时候，你把整个未来的愿景都建立在那个人的存在上，对吧？他们是你未来的一个公理，所以当他们消失，或者更糟糕的是，变成一个你不认识的人时，那就彻底摧毁了你的整个未来。

Part of the reason, for example, that if you get divorced, generally it's deeply upsetting, and the reason for that is, well, basically, especially if you're blindsided by the divorce, you state your entire vision of the future on the presence of that person, right? They're an axiom of your future, and so when they disappear, or worse, turn into someone that you didn't recognize, then that blows apart your whole future. 

这是一种深深的创伤，而且情况更糟，如果离婚伴随着背叛，你发现你以为你爱并了解的伴侣已经有了十年的婚外情。人们发现这种事情时，不仅失去了未来，虽然你肯定会失去未来；你还失去了过去。你会想，过去怎么会丢失呢，因为它已经发生了。答案是，你认为发生的事情并不是实际发生的事情，因此这会让你极度迷茫。如果你被深深地背叛了，不仅未来和过去都会失去，你也会失去自己和其他人。你失去自我的原因是，你肯定不是你以为的那个人，而你以为自己在做的事情实际上根本不是你在做的事情。所以，问题就出现了，那你是谁？竟然有人能够如此彻底地蒙蔽你，让你如此盲目或如此倒霉，这就引出了一个问题，世界如何才能构成这样的现实，使背叛成为可能。于是你不知道自己是谁，那么，你知道其他人是谁吗？

That's a deep wound, and it's worse than that because if you're divorced and it's accompanied by betrayal, you find out that your partner, whom you thought you loved and knew, had been having an affair for ten years. People discover that sort of thing, and then it's not like you just lose the future, although you certainly lose that; you also lose the past. You think, how can you lose the past because it already happened? The answer is, what you thought happened wasn't what happened, so that's extraordinarily disorienting. Not only do you lose the future and the past if you're deeply betrayed, but you also lose yourself and other people. The reason you lose yourself is because you aren't who you thought you were, and whatever you thought you were doing wasn't what you were doing at all. Then the question arises, who are you? You know that the wool could have been pulled over your eyes to that degree, and it begs the question of how the world could be constituted so that betrayal might be a reality. Then you don't know who you are, and then, well, do you know who other people are?

答案显然是否定的，因为你以为你最了解和爱的那个人，结果完全不是你想象中的样子。那么这对你与其他人的关系意味着什么？答案是，你根本不知道。而且，你知道，从这种状况走向一种苦涩的愤世嫉俗是非常直接的，但这肯定不是一个非常积极的结果。

The answer to that's pretty obviously no because the person you thought you knew the best and loved turned out to be nothing like anything you possibly imagined and so what does that mean for your relationship with other people and the answer is you have no idea and you know the pathway from that to a kind of bitter cynicism is pretty direct and but that's not a very positive outcome, that's for sure.

也许变得苦涩和愤世嫉俗比痛苦地天真要好，但这并不意味着这是一个好选择，尽管它可能在某种程度上是一种改进。所以，这是一种深深的创伤，而“深”意味着一切都会改变。深刻的故事具有这种效果；它们会深深地改变你。在《意义的地图》中，我试图分析深刻故事的结构，以及最深刻的故事中的角色的刻画和本质。显然，如果有一个故事，就必须有角色，这些角色扮演他们的部分。他们代表了我们所处的叙事现实的片段和元素。让我给你一个例子，作为一个小插曲，这样你就能明白我的意思：弗洛伊德。

Maybe it's better to be bitter and cynical than to be painfully naive, but that doesn't mean it's a bad trade, even though it might be somewhat of an improvement. So that's a deep wound, and deep means everything changes. Deep stories have that effect; they change you deeply. In Maps of Meaning, I tried to analyze the structure of deep stories, as well as the characterization, the nature of the characters in the deepest of stories. Obviously, if there's a story, there have to be characters, and these characters play their parts. They represent fragments, elements of the narrative reality that we inhabit. Let me give you an example of this, as a bit of a side story, so you can see where I'm going: Freud.

### 弗洛伊德：本我、自我、超我

弗洛伊德是一位心理学家、精神病学家、精神分析学家，是世界上第一批正式的治疗师之一，是那些积极发现所谓的谈话疗法可以对心理生理产生变革作用的人之一，他重新发现了忏悔和对话的救赎能力，从世俗的角度来说。他用三个角色充实了他的世俗宇宙，其中一个角色就是“本我”。“本我”在德语中意为“它”。本我实际上是本能在你体内表现出来的自然领域。弗洛伊德有神经学背景，是一位生物学思想家，对于一个19世纪末写作的人来说，他为生物学基础上的精神病学奠定了初步的基础，做得相当不错。

Now, Freud was a psychologist, a psychiatrist, a psychoanalyst, one of the world's first formal therapists, one of the people who positively discovered that so-called talk therapy could be psychophysiologically transforming, who rediscovered the redemptive capacity, let's say in a secular sense, of confession and dialogue, dialogos, and he peopled his secular universe with three characters, and one of those characters was the ID. The ID is the "it" that's what it means in German, it, and the ID was really the natural domain of instincts as they manifested themselves within you. It was pretty, Freud was neurologically oriented, and he was a biological thinker, and he did a pretty good job for someone who was writing in the late 1800s of fleshing out the initial groundwork for something like a biologically predicated psychiatry.

弗洛伊德知道，或者假设，我们被子人格所居住，这是一种思考方式，这些子人格可以控制我们，并且这些子人格与极其强大的情绪状态相关联。因此，对弗洛伊德来说，他处理的主要情绪，特别是因为他关注精神病理学和精神疾病，正是那些你可能认为最难整合进人格的情绪。

Freud knew that we were, or posited, hypothesized that we were inhabited, that's a way of thinking about it, by sub-personalities that could control us, that those sub-personalities were associated with profoundly powerful states of emotion. So for Freud, the cardinal emotions that he dealt with, particularly because he was concerned with psychopathology, with mental illness, were precisely those emotions that you might regard as most difficult to integrate into the personality. 

因此，这些情绪就是攻击和性的本能，因为显而易见的原因，我认为无需多言。这些都是非常麻烦的情绪或驱动力，性驱动力和攻击驱动力。它们很难在社会中整合。性往往是私人的行为，从某种意义上说，它是一种自私的行为，因为我们倾向于发展长期的、永久的配偶关系，这意味着我们必须把我们在一起的人从市场上带走，不再属于其他人。希望如此，这确实很难，这又回到了离婚问题。这很难与对社会平等和分享的更广泛承诺相调和。你不会分享你的配偶。

And so, those would be the instincts of aggression and sex, right, because, well, for obvious reasons I don't think I have to belabor that point. Those are very troublesome emotions or drives, sexual drive, and the drive to aggression. They're hard to integrate socially. Sex tends to be a private act. It's a selfish act in some sense because,  we tend to develop long-term, permanent mating partners, and that means we have to take the person that we're with out of the market for everyone else, so that's hard to, hopefully, that's hard to, back to the divorce problem there. That's hard to reconcile with a broader commitment, say, to social equality and sharing. You don't share your mate. 

然后，攻击当然也有同样的问题，因为当你有攻击性时，你在某种程度上是对抗社会秩序的。因此，很容易生成这样的假设：为了成为一个社会化的人类，你必须学会抑制你的攻击性，可能你还必须学会抑制你的性欲，在某种程度上，这是正确的，尽管这不是一个很好的模式。我认为整合模式比抑制模式更好，但如果你不能整合，那么至少你应该被抑制。所以，弗洛伊德的观点是有道理的。

And then, aggression, of course, has the same problem because when you're aggressive, you're striving, in some ways, against social order, and it's easy to generate the hypothesis that to become a socialized human being, you have to learn to inhibit your aggression, maybe you have to learn to inhibit your sexual desire, and to some degree, that's true, although it's not a great model. I think an integration model is better than an inhibition model, but if you can't be integrated, man, then you should at least be inhibited. So,  Freud had a point.

现在，对弗洛伊德来说，本我是一个角色。它是这股黑暗、沸腾的、未受约束的狄奥尼索斯情感，推动着我们前进。弗洛伊德是一个非常聪明的人，所以他指出，本我的本性既有积极的一面，也有消极的一面。积极的一面是动机状态的活力，比如如果你生气了，你会前进；如果你性欲高涨，同样的倾向也会出现，除非你深陷于色情中，在这种情况下，你的一个基本动机驱动力往往会受到严重打击。当然，这是我们社会目前的一个典型问题，即缺乏最佳的适度剥夺。

Now, the ID for Freud, that was one character, the ID. It was this dark, seething mass of unbridled Dionysian emotion propelling us forward. And Freud was a very wise man, and so he pointed out that the ID nature had a positive element and a negative element, and the positive element was the dynamism of motivational states,  like if you're angry, man, you'll move forward,  and if you're sexually aroused, the same proclivity obtains, unless you're, like, neck-deep in pornography, in which case, one of your fundamental motivating drives tends to take a vicious hit, and of course, that's a characteristic problem in our society right now, the lack of optimal deprivation, let's say. 

但弗洛伊德知道，本我是非常危险的，因为它是未受约束的激情的居所，但它也有极其积极的一面，因为它是他所描述的力比多的源泉，而力比多基本上是推动你在人生中前进的能量。所以，弗洛伊德不是一个头脑简单的人，他没有简单地抛弃攻击性和性欲具有积极元素的观点。他是一个成熟的思想家，所以在本我中，有两个角色，一个是积极的角色，一个是消极的角色，一个是积极的激发精神，一个是消极的激发精神。

But Freud knew that the ID was very dangerous in that it was the home of unbridled passion, let's say, but also extraordinarily positive because it was the source of what he described as libido, and libido was basically the energy that moved you forward in life. And so Freud wasn't a simple-minded person, and he didn't just dispense with the notion of aggression and sexuality, let's say, having their positive elements. He was a mature thinker, so in the ID, there were two characters, there was a positive character and a negative character, a positive animating spirit and a negative animating spirit. 

然后，下一个层次，也就是最底层，本我，是在你体内沸腾的自然。然后是作为个体的你，即自我。自我也有积极和消极的元素。你有自我，作为统一存在的中心。你可以变得自我中心；自我可能会失控，但它是一种必要的适应，一种统一的适应。

And then the next, so that's the bottom level, the ID, nature bubbling up within you, and then there's you as the individual, that's the ego, and the ego had a positive and negative element as well. You have your ego, your center of unified being. You can become egotistical; the ego can get out of hand, but it's a necessary adaptation, a unifying adaptation. 

再往上，在某种意义上说的“天堂”，如果说本我是“地狱”，而自我是在地球表面行走的，那么上面是超我，它有点像在“天堂”。超我是文化，与自然相对立，它是另一个压制你的巨人。根据弗洛伊德的模型，你被压在超我的重压之下，超我总是告诉你如何行为并抑制你，试图按照社会秩序塑造你；同时，你也被本我的巨大力量推动着生物学上的前进。

And then above that, in heaven let's say, if it is in hell in some ways, and the ego is walking around on the surface of the earth, you have the superego, and it's sort of in heaven. The superego is culture as opposed to nature, and it's the other Titan that crushes you. From the Freudian model, you're crushed between the weight of the superego, always telling you how to behave and inhibiting you, trying to shape you in accordance with social order, and the titanic force of the id driving you forward biologically. 

然后，你的自我夹在中间，试图应对这些巨大的力量。超我也有积极和消极的元素。积极的一面是调节和约束你，抑制你，使你能够成为社会秩序的一部分。消极的一面是严厉、批判和专横。你可以把女权主义对父权制的看法看作是对超我的一种讽刺，对吧？这是超我，只是其消极的一面。弗洛伊德模型之所以如此有影响力的一部分原因在于，弗洛伊德本质上是世俗的，因为它有一个非常好的原型叙事结构。它涵盖了所有领域。你需要一个既有积极又有消极的自然的表征，一个既有积极又有消极的个体的表征，以及一个既有积极又有消极的文化的表征。

Then there's your ego in the middle trying to deal with these titanic forces, and the superego has a positive element and a negative element as well. The positive element regulates and disciplines you, inhibits you so that you can be part of the social order. The negative part is harsh, judgmental, and domineering. You could think about the feminist notion of the patriarchy as a parody of the superego, right? It's the superego, only the negative side. Part of the reason the Freudian model was so influential, Freud was secular in nature, is because it has a very good archetypal narrative structure. It covers the territory. You need a representation of nature that's positive and negative, a representation of the individual that's positive and negative, and a representation of culture that's positive and negative.

为什么？让我们更深入地思考一下。让我们思考自然。我们会想到“母亲自然”，因为“母亲自然”是我们想到自然时自然会跳出的比喻。不是“父亲自然”，而是“母亲自然”，这很有趣。这就像是一个内建的生物学比喻。我认为部分原因，顺便说一下，部分原因是因为女性就是自然。这里有一个达尔文的解释：自然是选择的对象，在生物学上，因为即使在自然选择过程中，自然也会决定生死。它进行选择。这正是女性在性选择方面所做的事情。她们是繁殖的守门人。从这个意义上说，她们就是自然。女性决定你的基因是否传播，所以她们在这个意义上是自然。

Why? Let's go a little deeper. Let's think about nature. We'll think Mother nature because Mother nature is the metaphor we naturally jump to when we think of nature. It's not Father nature; it's Mother nature, and that's interesting. It's like an inbuilt biological metaphor. I think part of the reason, by the way, part of the reason that it's Mother nature is because women are nature. So here's a Darwinian explanation: Nature is that which selects, okay, on the biological front, right? Because even in the course of natural selection, nature kills and allows to live. It does the selection. That's exactly what women do on the sexual selection front. They're the gatekeepers of reproduction. So they are nature in that sense. Women decide whether your genetic material propagates. So they are nature insofar as.

女性拥有这种力量确实很让人烦恼，但如果不是这样，我们就不会是现在的样子。因为自然选择和性选择在决定所有动物的进化过程中都起着重要作用。这也确实是事实。比如说，蝴蝶之所以如此美丽，部分原因是性选择。这很奇怪，对吧？因为它们是昆虫，只是虫子，但看看它们，它们如此美丽，令人难以置信。而且，蝴蝶可以检测到百万分之一的对称偏差，并且不会与不对称的伙伴交配。就像蝴蝶，它们喜欢美，它们对美非常挑剔，这太令人惊讶了，这真的是一个奇迹。我完全不明白这怎么可能，尤其是因为蝴蝶的美是如此超凡脱俗，以至于我们都能感知到，对吧？

It's very annoying that they have that power, but we wouldn't be what we are if that wasn't the case, because it's definitely the case that both natural selection and sexual selection play a major role in determining the course of evolution in all sorts of animals. I mean, part of the reason butterflies are so beautiful is because of sexual selection. That's pretty weird, eh? Because they're insects, they're just bugs, and look at them, they're so beautiful, you just can't believe it. And,  a butterfly can detect a deviation from symmetry of one part in a million and will not mate with an asymmetrical partner. It's like butterflies, man, they like beauty, they're really picky about it, and that's amazing, it's really, it's a miracle. I just, I don't understand it at all, that that can be the case, it's especially because the beauty of a butterfly is so transcendently real that we can even perceive it, you know? 

虽然我们和蝴蝶有很大不同，但我们都喜欢美和对称。所以，我们有“母亲自然”，为什么我们需要一个积极的母亲和一个消极的母亲？我们有一个自然的表征，我们需要一个积极的表征和一个消极的表征。如果你看看世界各地的女神形象，你会发现它们大致分为两类：一类是消极的吞噬死亡的女神，另一类是积极的仁慈丰饶的女神。而在牺牲仪式和崇拜女神的文化中，你所做的一部分就是向黑暗女神献祭，希望她能被有益的女神取代，当然，这也是你与妻子相处时一直在做的事情，对吧？

And we're a lot different than butterflies, except we both like beauty and symmetry as it turns out. So, we have Mother nature, and why do we need a positive mother and a negative mother? So, we have a representation of nature, and we need a positive representation and a negative representation. If you look at the representations of goddesses around the world, you find that they fall into two broad classes: there's negative devouring goddesses of death, and then there's positive benevolent goddesses of plenty. And part of what you do in a sacrificial ritual and a goddess-worshipping culture is you sacrifice something to the dark goddess in hope that she'll be replaced by the beneficial goddess, and of course, that's what you do with your wife all the time, right? 

有时候，这种方法甚至会成功，这虽然是个玩笑，但也是事实，这是人类的故事，因为作为一个物种，我们在仪式中学到的是，通过献祭来换取自然的丰饶。当你对未来做出决定，努力争取某些东西时，你其实是在牺牲当前的冲动以实现长远的愿景，你在做一种交易。这不仅仅是与自然的交易，但也部分是与自然的交易。交易的内容是，如果我做出适当的牺牲，自然本身就会对我照耀出积极的光芒。你不知道这是否是真的，因为你不知道如果你决定为某件事情努力，它是否真的会发生。

So, sometimes it's even successful, it's a joke, but it's also the truth, and it's the story of humanity because what we have learned as a species, we do this in ritual, is to offer something up so that nature bestows its plenitude on us. Like when you make a decision about the future you're gonna work for something, hey, what you're doing is you're sacrificing your impulses in the present to a long-term vision, and you're making a bargain. It's not just with nature, but it's partly with nature. Then the bargain is if I make the proper sacrifice, then nature itself will shine its positive light on me, and you don't know if that's true because you don't know if you decide to work for something, you don't know if it's gonna happen.

你必须真诚地做出牺牲，因为你没有事先的证据，但我们都深信不疑，就像牺牲的发现是人类最伟大的发现之一。这是一个如此深刻的发现，认为你可以在现在放弃某些东西，以便在未来受益，通过牺牲来改变你的命运。这是一个令人震惊的发现。动物会表现出这种行为，因为像海狸这样的动物会工作，但它们并不真正知道自己在工作，而我们知道我们在放弃现在的一些东西，以使未来更美好。我们能够以这种方式与现实讨价还价，这实在是太奇怪了。从象征层面来看，这意味着我们在安抚自然，我们在献祭，以使可怕的女神消失，仁慈的女神出现。

You have to make the sacrifice in good faith because you don't have the evidence before you, but we all do believe very deeply, like the discovery of sacrifice was one of the greatest discoveries of the human race. It's such a profound discovery, the notion that you can give up something in the present to benefit from the future, that you can change your destiny through sacrifice. That's a staggering discovery. I mean, animals will act that out,  because animals like beavers will work, but they don't really know they're working, where we know that we're giving something up in the present to make the future better. And it's so strange that we can bargain with reality in that way. And what it means at the symbolic level is we're propitiating nature, we're offering a sacrifice so that the dread goddess disappears and the benevolent goddess appears. 

你需要这种双重表征，因为大自然是血淋淋的、爪牙毕露的，是一个可怕的、绝对灾难性的梦魇之地。就像你愿意在夜晚被赤裸裸地丢在亚马逊雨林中间吗？答案是，如果你有理智的话，你绝对不愿意，因为你活下来的概率几乎为零。因此，你需要对自然的消极方面有一个表征，因为没有它，你就无法为与自然界的原始力量直接接触所带来的绝对灾难做好准备。但你也需要对积极元素的表征，因为尽管自然不断在谋杀我们，但它也是我们生存所需一切的来源。

And you need that dual representation because nature is red in tooth and claw, a terrible, absolutely catastrophic nightmare of a place. It's like you want to be dropped naked in the middle of the Amazon at night, and the answer is not if you have any sense because the probability that you're gonna live through that's pretty much zero. So,  you need a representation of the negative aspect of nature because without that, you're just not prepared for the absolute cataclysm of unmediated contact with the brute force of the natural world. But you also need a representation of the positive element because despite the fact that nature is constantly conspiring to kill us, it's also the source of everything that we need to live. 

逻辑学家会说，“一件事物不能同时是它自己和它的对立面。” 这没错，但你知道自然界正是这样不断变化的。我们有一个悖论性的问题，即在这种可怕的悖论存在时，我们如何理解并应对消极面，同时理解并应对积极面？你可能会说，“我不想处理这个问题。” 但这对你来说太糟糕了，你必须处理这个问题，否则你就会死去。所以这是一个大问题。因此，一个复杂的叙事总是包含自然界的积极方面，通常是女性化的，以及消极方面。而这个故事的一部分是如何将一个方面转化为另一个方面，这实际上在最终分析中是一个宗教难题。

And so that's,  logicians say, "Well, one thing can't be itself and its opposite at the same time." It's like, fair enough, but you know what about nature, which is exactly that all the time? And then we have this paradoxical problem, which is,  how do we apprehend and cope with the negative and apprehend and cope with the positive when that terrible paradox exists? And you might say, "I don't want to deal with that." Well, too bad for you, man, you have to deal with that or you just die. And so it's a big problem. And so a sophisticated narrative always has a positive aspect of the natural world, generally feminine, and a negative aspect. And part of that story is how you transform one to the other, and that's actually a religious conundrum in the final analysis.

在父权制方面，你可以从女权主义中看到这一点。设想一下，女权主义者提出的观点是，所有的社会关系，包括婚姻，所有的社会关系，无论其范围和在社会层级中的位置，基本上都是父权压迫的表现，这是一种消极的男性叙事。

And then on the patriarchal side, and you see this with feminism, so imagine that there's the notion that feminists put forth that human society, all social relations including marriage, all social relations regardless of their expanse and position in the social hierarchy are basically manifestations of patriarchal oppression, and that's a narrative of the negative masculine. 

一个复杂的叙述包含两方面。就像，嗯，有负面的男性形象，那会是什么样的呢？那就是暴政，它是邪恶的国王本质上的表现。它是暴政和压迫、权力和统治、僵化的等级组织、对自然的征服、对女性的征服、奴隶制和战争，是狭隘、僵化、父权制和军事化态度的体现，是社会中所有消极的东西，是社会和社会层级中所有消极的东西。这就是父权制。历史是血腥的，这点没错，历史中充满了关于权力如何腐蚀制度的故事，每一种关系，每一种人类关系都在某种程度上被使用强制和权力的倾向所污染。当人们之间的关系恶化时，它们确实会变成一种类似于权力关系，而不是自愿结合的关系。

And a sophisticated narrative has both. It's like, yeah, well, there's the negative masculine, and what would that be? It'd be tyranny, and it's the evil king fundamentally. It's tyranny and oppression, and power, and domination, and rigid hierarchical organization, and the subjugation of nature, and the subjugation of women, and slavery, and warfare, and what a narrow, rigid, patriarchal, militaristic attitude, and it's everything about society that's negative, everything about society and social hierarchies that's negative. That's the patriarchy, and like,  fair enough because history is bloody, but bloodbath, and there's no shortage of stories about how institutions become corrupted by power, and every relationship, every human relationship is contaminated to some degree by the proclivity to use compulsion and power, and when relationships between people deteriorate, they do deteriorate into something approximating a relationship of power rather than voluntary association. 

所以，认为存在一种父权制，并且它是消极的，这是正确的，但这只是半对，这是问题所在。你需要另一半，因为，这就是让我们来看让-雅克·卢梭和托马斯·霍布斯之间的区别。顺便说一句，我并不是特别欣赏卢梭，他认为自然状态是高贵的野蛮人，在邪恶文明出现之前，我们都过着平等、共产主义的狩猎采集者的美好生活，大家都相亲相爱。这完全是谎言，猎人采集者社区的谋杀率会让西方最糟糕的内城区看起来像一个完美的天堂。因此，认为在邪恶的父权制兴起之前，我们都像“Kumbaya”[^1]那样相亲相爱，这完全是不真实的，恰恰相反。

And so the notion that there's a, let's call it a patriarchy and that it's negative is true, but it's only half true, that's the problem, is that you need the other half because, and this is the difference between Jean-Jacques Rousseau, let's say, and Thomas Hobbes because Rousseau, I'm not an admirer of Rousseau particularly, by the way, he kind of thought of nature as the state of nature, the noble savages before the dawn of evil civilization, we all lived the wonderful life of egalitarian, communist hunter-gatherers, and everybody loved each other, which is a complete bloody lie, like the rate of murder in hunter-gatherer communities would make the worst inner-city neighborhood in the West look like a complete bloody paradise, and so the notion that at some point in history before the rise of the evil patriarch, we were all like Kumbaya loving our brothers. It's just not true even in the tiniest degree, quite the contrary.

所以卢梭的观点是，高贵的野蛮人被邪恶的父权工业体系所扭曲。这就是为什么会有战争的原因，我们天生是善良的，但社会扭曲了我们。

And so Rousseau's proposition was, noble savage, evil, patriarchal, industrial complex warps everyone. That's why there's war, we're naturally good, but society warps us.

与此相对，哲学家托马斯·霍布斯持有相反的观点，他生活在与卢梭大致相同的时期。他说，不，人类在自然状态下几乎注定会陷入灾难。生活是残酷、野蛮且短暂的，唯一能够接近和平命运和合理心理整合的方法是建立一个真正的社区。通过社会化和社区的建立，我们实际上变得文明，从那种残酷的自然状态中脱离出来，并通过社会化过程变得比原来更好。

That's why we come become more like and Thomas Hobbes philosopher who lived at approximately the same time had the opposite view and he said no people are pretty much counted a catastrophe in the state of nature life is nasty brutish and short and the only way forward to something approximating a peaceful destiny and reasonable psychological integration is the establishment of a genuine community right is that and then socialization and the establishment community actually civilizes us and it takes us out of that brutal state of nature and we become better than we are through the process of socialization.

你可能会问，谁是对的？卢梭，认为社会腐蚀了我们，还是霍布斯，认为社会使我们高贵？如果你有理智，你会说，悖论地，两者都是对的。因为你非常清楚，当你上学时，你本可以成为的许多东西被压制了。你必须学会像其他人一样，这意味着你不能成为那个理论上独特的自己。但同样，如果没有周围的朋友，没有你必须学会与之交往的同伴，你就会变成一个自私、自恋的黄鼠狼，以一种狭隘、冲动的方式只为自己谋利，这正是未成熟享乐主义者的特征。

And you might say, well, who's right? Rousseau, who claims that society corrupts us, or Hobbes, who claims that society ennobles us? And if you have any sense, you'd say paradoxically, they're both. Because you know perfectly well when you went to school, a lot of what you could have been was just crushed out of you. And the fact that you had to learn how to be like other people meant that you couldn't be the special you that you could theoretically be. But by the same token, if you didn't have your friends around you, the peers that you had to learn to associate with, you'd just be some selfish narcissistic weasel that was out for himself in this narrowly impulsive manner that characterizes immature hedonists.

所以，你在社会化的过程中发展和成长。有些过程是破坏性的和抑制性的，它浪费了你卓越的独特创造潜力。但很多过程使你成为一个文明的人，使你能够体面地打扮，来到这样的场所，而不会对周围的人构成生存威胁。

So you develop and grow as a process of socialization. And some of that's destructive and inhibitory, lays waste to your spectacular idiosyncratic creative potential. But a lot of it makes you the sort of civilized person that can get dressed up half decently and come into a venue like this without posing an existential threat to everyone around you.

所以，一个智慧的故事会描述这两种元素。既有贤明的国王，也有邪恶的国王，你必须知道两者都存在。你必须警惕邪恶的国王，因为你知道他是邪恶的国王，时刻在幕后操纵事情。但你也应该对贤明的国王怀有一点感激之情，因为你知道，我们在这里，环境很平和，灯是亮的，电子设备运作正常，到目前为止电力供应顺畅。我们有我们需要的东西，有足够的食物和水，感谢上帝。所以在面对父权制时，应该有一点感激之情。你可以保持这种观点，同时认为，一点社会批评不是坏事，我们还可以做得更好。你需要有一个邪恶的国王和一个贤明的国王。

So, you know, a wise story provides a characterization of both of those elements. There's the wise king and the evil king, and you have to know that both exist. And you have to keep an eye out for the evil king because you know he's an evil king and manipulating things behind the scenes constantly. But you should have a little gratitude for the wise king because you know, here we are, and it's all peaceful in here, and the lights are on, and the electronics work, and so far the power is flowing through the grid. And you know, we've got what we need, and we have enough food, and we have enough water, and thank God for that. So a little gratitude is in order in relationship to the patriarchy. And you can have that viewpoint still, think, you know, yeah, but you know, little social criticisms not such a bad thing, and we could still do better. You have to have an evil king and a wise king.

你有积极的母亲自然和消极的母亲自然，有邪恶的国王和贤明的国王，现在你开始充实整个叙事的景观。然后你有了个体，你认为，人们本质上是好的，除非社会腐蚀了他们。这并不对，他们不是本质上善良的。你有孩子吗？你照过镜子吗？你不是本质上善良的。首先，如果你本质上是善良的，而社会扭曲了你，那么这种扭曲从何而来？因为人们构建了社会，如果他们本质上是善良的，社会怎么会如此扭曲以至于扭曲了你？扭曲必须来自某个地方，它不可能源自本质上善良的人，所以这理论从一开始就是荒谬的。

You've got positive Mother Nature and negative Mother Nature, and the evil king and the wise king, and now you're starting to flesh out the whole narrative landscape. And then you have the individual, and you think, well, people are naturally good except insofar as society corrupts them. It's like, no, they're not intrinsically good. Have you had a child? You know, have you looked in the mirror? It's like, you're not intrinsically... First of all, if you were intrinsically good and society warped you, it's like, where did the warp come from? Because people made society, and if they were intrinsically good, how did society get so warped as to warp you? The warp had to come from somewhere, and it couldn't spring from intrinsically good people, so that's just a foolish theory to begin with.

事实是，我们是一团复杂的倾向，其中一些是高尚的、鼓舞人心的，向善的，努力向耶路撒冷之城进发。而我们中的一些，或者说我们每个人中的一部分，以及某些人中的更多部分，尽可能努力和勤奋地朝向地狱的某个地方前进。这两种精神都在你内心。

And you know, the truth of the matter is, we're a mess of proclivities, some of which are noble and uplifting, and moving towards the good, and striving uphill towards the city of Jerusalem, and all of that. And some of us, or some of each of us, and more of us than others in some cases, are aiming down to something approximating hell with as much effort and diligence as we can possibly manage. And both of those spirits are inside of you.

如果你有理智，你会喂养那个走向高处的自己，而饿死那个不走高处的自己，在这方面你会比较明智。但如果你认为你内心只有善良的部分，那你就是一个彻头彻尾的傻瓜。而且你也是一个危险的傻瓜，因为你认为自己是圣人，但实际上可能不是。如果你认为自己是圣人而实际上不是，那么你就是一个伪君子，这是肯定的。伪君子几乎不可能以积极的方式行事。

And if you have any sense, you feed the one that's walking uphill, and you starve the one that isn't, and you're somewhat sensible in that regard. But you're a bloody fool if you think that all there is within you is that which is good. And you're a dangerous fool too because you think you're a saint, and probably you're not. And if you think you're a saint and you're not, well, then you're a hypocrite, that's for sure. And the probability that you're gonna act in a positive manner and be a hypocrite is pretty much zero.

现在，你对整个叙事世界有了一个相当完善的描述。你有自然及其积极的一面，自然及其消极的一面，这通常以女性符号呈现。然后你有文化，这通常以男性符号呈现，即秩序的象征。

So now you have a fairly well-fleshed-out characterization of the whole narrative world. You have nature and its positive guys, and nature and its negative guys, that's generally presented using female symbols. And then you have culture, and that's generally presented using masculine symbols, symbols of order.

我已经提出了一个论点，尽管不是我发明的，即通常秩序是用男性来表示，混沌是用女性来表示，这不是一个价值判断，因为所有新的事物都从混沌中产生，所以混沌是丰饶本身的源泉，也是生活乐趣的源泉，因为生活中的乐趣部分在于不断用混沌之水来补充原本会变得沉闷和麻木的秩序，这也是一个非常古老的叙事主题。

You know, I've made the case, although it's not a case that I invented, that generally the order is represented with the masculine and chaos is represented with the feminine, and that's not a value judgment, because all new things emerge from chaos, and so it's the source of plenitude itself and what would you say delight in life because partly what's delightful about life is the constant replenishment of what would otherwise become dull and stultifying order with the water of chaos, and that's a very old narrative motif as well.

你有积极的母亲和消极的母亲，有积极的父亲和消极的父亲，然后你有积极的个体和消极的个体，这通常也被描绘成男性，通常被描绘成儿子。我不会深入讨论其中的原因，这很复杂，我们没有时间，但我想指出的是，一个完整的叙事包含所有这些角色，而一个完整的叙事，描绘所有这些角色，基本上具有一种原型宗教的结构。这是一个定义问题。如果你接触到一个以复杂方式充实所有这些维度的叙事，它具有宗教启示的力量，会深深吸引你。这就是为什么人们对弗洛伊德如此着迷的原因。

You have the positive mother and the negative mother, and you have the positive father and the negative father, then you have the positive individual and the negative individual generally characterized also as a male, generally characterized as a son, and I'm not going to go into the reasons for that, they're complicated and we don't have time to do that, but what I wanted to point out is that a complete narrative gives you all those characters, and a complete narrative that portrays all those characters essentially has an archetypally religious structure. This is a matter of definition. If you're exposed to a narrative that fleshes out all those dimensions in a sophisticated manner, it has the force of a religious revelation, it will grip you. That's why people were so entranced with Freud.

弗洛伊德是一个世俗主义者，但他在他的世俗哲学中复制了宗教结构，因此它适合，至少在某种程度上是有效的。后来我意识到还有另一个角色，我不会详细讨论，这是第七个角色，那就是混沌之龙，它是所有这些其他角色的源头。它本身就是潜力，是自然、文化和个体所从中产生的潜力。我不会深入讨论这个问题，因为太复杂了，但我提一下，为了完整性。

Freud was a secularist, but he replicated the religious structure in his secular philosophy, and so it fit, it worked, at least to some degree. Then I realized after, there's another character that I won't talk about, there's a seventh character, and that's the dragon of chaos, and it's sort of the source of all these other characters. It's potential itself, underlying what would you say, it's the potential from which nature and culture and the individual emerge. I won't go into that, it's too complicated, but I'll just mention it for the sake of completion.

现在，一个包含这些角色之间互动的叙事，如果优雅且出色地完成，会深深吸引你。如果你读《哈利·波特》系列，或者试试《指环王》，你会发现你可以将主要角色映射到这个基础架构上。这些叙事之所以如此引人入胜，是因为它们为你提供了每一个存在现实领域的角色。你之所以觉得这些叙事有吸引力，是因为你需要了解所有这些存在现实领域的特征，否则你无法生存。你必须能够应对自然的消极方面、文化的消极方面，以及你自己灵魂的恐怖，否则，你无法前进，迟早会被击倒。

Now, a narrative that contains an account of the interactions between these characters that's done elegantly and well will grip you. If you walk through the Harry Potter series, for example, you could try this with Lord of the Rings too, you'll see that you can map the major characters onto this underlying schema, and the reason those narratives are deeply gripping is because they provide you with a character for every one of those domains of existential reality. The reason you find that compelling is that you need to understand the character of all those domains of existential reality or you cannot survive. You have to be able to cope with the negative aspect of nature, the negative aspect of culture, and like the horrors of your own soul; otherwise, there's no moving forward for you, you're gonna be taken out at some point or the other. 

同样，你必须了解自然中的积极方面和未知领域，你必须对文化所提供的一切心怀感激，你必须对人类精神的高贵有一些认识。你必须有一种涵盖整个景观的矛盾视角，因为那是你生活的存在或现象学景观。如果你没有那张地图，你就会迷失方向，掉进陷阱。所以，宗教故事的作用是为你提供一条穿越这种角色环境的路径。一部分是仪式，比如牺牲的仪式，一部分是以不同方式充实这些角色的叙事，一部分是社区实践。

And equally, you have to know about what's positive about nature and unknown, and you have to be grateful for what culture has offered you, and you have to have some sense of the nobility of the human spirit, and you have to have that paradoxical view which covers the entire landscape because that's the existential or phenomenological landscape of your life. If you don't have that map, then you'll wander lost and fall into a pit. So, what religious stories do is provide you with a through way through that environment of characterization. Some of that's ritual, rituals of sacrifice, for example, some of it's narrative that fleshes out these characters in different ways, some of it's communal practice.

但宗教活动的目的是为你提供一个涵盖所有领域的深刻导向叙事，这本质上就是那些领域。那么你可能会问，什么是意识形态？我认为，意识形态是分裂的宗教叙事。

But the purpose of the religious enterprise is to provide you with a deep orienting narrative that covers the territory, and that's essentially the territory. So then you might ask, what's an ideology? And I think an ideology is a fractionated religious narrative.

回到亚历克斯·爱泼斯坦。环境运动背后的叙事是这样的：自然是一个脆弱的、无助的处女；文化是一个贪婪的暴虐暴徒；而个体是一个破坏性的掠夺性寄生虫。问题是，这是真的，这就是为什么它能吸引人，但问题是它只是半真，对吧？它是真的，吸引你，因为它有一个宗教的底层结构，它涵盖了那些领域。

And so back to Alex Epstein. So here's the narrative that underlies the environmental movement. Nature is a fragile, hapless, virgin. Culture is a rapacious tyrannical mob and the individual is a destructive predatory parasite, and the thing is, it's true, that's why it grips people, but the problem is it's half true, right? It's true and it grips you because it has a religious substructure, it covers the territory. 

因为如果你有一个院子，你就得照顾你的花园。如果你不小心，不浇水，太阳会把它烧死，然后它会枯萎，变得丑陋，飞走，你就不能住在那里，变得令人难以忍受。所以，你显然要照顾好花园，从这个意义上说，它是脆弱的。至于文化，当然在某些方面是贪婪和破坏性的。

Because if you have a yard, you have to take care of your garden, you know, and if you're incautious, you don't water it, the sun will burn it, it'll die, and then it's ugly, and it blows away, and you can't live there, and it's hideous, and so you got to take care of the garden, obviously, and so in that sense it's fragile, and with regards to culture, well of course it's rapacious and destructive in some regard. 

比如，当我们进行像挖煤这样的工业活动时，可能不得不摧毁整座山，这也会造成严重后果。你可能会把毒物倒入邻近的溪流中，破坏那些维持你生存的东西，这样做出于自私和短视的原因，显然是不好的。同样，你可以成为一个无知而破坏性的消费者，只拿取而不付出，我们应该意识到这一点，并努力纠正这些问题，但这只是故事的一半。

I mean, when we undertake an industrial enterprise like digging for coal, maybe you have to destroy a whole mountain, and you know that can go too far. You can dump poison into the adjoining streams and destroy that which sustains you, and you can do that for selfish and short-sighted reasons. Obviously, that's not good. Then you can clearly be a mindless and destructive consumer, only taking and not giving, and we should be aware of that. We should strive to rectify all of that, but it's half the story.

因为另一半的原因是，我在阿尔伯塔北部长大，那离美国边境有800英里。那里的自然环境并不是那么纯洁和仁慈。我们镇上有酒鬼，但他们通常活不长，因为我们镇上的酒鬼会在某个晚上醉醺醺地回家，结果头朝下倒在雪堆里，没过一小时就被冻得硬邦邦的。那里常常是零下40度，我刚上大学时，有38天连续零下40度，有时甚至达到零下48度。轮胎会冻平，需要一段时间才能解冻，前提是你能启动你的车，而通常情况下，如果你不让车整夜运行，你根本启动不了。

Because the other half is, well, I was very sensitive to this growing up in northern Alberta, 800 miles north of the American border. Nature up there wasn't all that virginal and benevolent. We had town drunks, but they didn't last very long because generally what happened in our town is the town drunk would wander home drunk one night and end up headfirst in a snowbank, frozen solid within an hour. So, because it was 40 below up there a lot when I first went to college — it was 40 below for 38 days in a row — and sometimes even 48 below, your tires freeze flat on the bottom, and it takes them a while to thaw out, assuming you can get your car started, which you generally couldn't unless you left it running overnight.

在那样的地方，你会学到，自然并不是什么仁慈的存在，而是“红牙利爪”[^2]。你会非常感激自己住在一个有保温效果的房子里，并且有稳定供应的天然气。

And so you learned in a place like that that nature was not exactly anything other than red in tooth and claw, you know, and you're pretty damn grateful that you lived in an insulated house with a pretty decent regular supply of natural gas. 

许多人过着这样的生活，那些相对接近自然的人，他们知道，从没有过多的痛苦和冲突的最佳生存状态，到陷入自然世界的恐怖之间的界限非常非常薄。城市里的人们被这种界限保护得很好，因为在最根本的层面上，事情是如此难以置信的可预测，我们非常、非常、非常、非常、非常、非常容易浪漫化自然。

Lots of people live like that, people who are relatively close to nature, they know that the border between optimized existence without too much pain and strife and cataclysmic descent into the horrors of the natural world aligns very, very thin. Urban people are very much protected from that, because things are so unbelievably predictable in the most fundamental way that it's very, very, very, very easy for us to romanticize nature. 

这部分原因是每当我们看到自然时，都是在度假期间，一切都被照顾得很好，你看到的只是美丽的一面，你会觉得整个星球都是法国印象派的风景画，但事实显然不是这样。

And that's partly because whenever we see nature, it's on some vacation where everything's taken care of and all you see is what's beautiful and you do think the whole bloody planet is a French impressionist landscape which it most decidedly is not. 

你对此感到自鸣得意，这很容易，但了解自然是血淋淋的“红牙利爪”非常有用，如果你被你的衣物、房子、家庭、社区、国家、军队和核武器保护着，那么你就非常幸运，可以坐在这里假装你热爱自然，认为她是纯洁的处女。

You get high on your horse about that too and that's real easy but it's very useful to know that you know nature is red in tooth and claw and you're bloody lucky if you're protected by your clothing and your house and your family and your community and your state and your army and your nuclear weapons so that you can sit here and pretend that you just love nature and that she's a pristine virgin. 

事实并非如此，同样的道理也适用于所谓的父权制上层结构。显然，有人会操纵系统，有百分之五的人是精神病患者，他们玩零和游戏，相互剥削，正如我所说，人类的社会关系在某种程度上确实可以仅仅基于权力和强制，

It's like no, I know, and the same thing applies with regards to the so-called patriarchal superstructure, you know it's like you know of course people manipulate the system and there are five percent of the population are psychopaths and they're people who play zero-sum games and they exploit each other, you know, and to some degree as I said human social relationships can be based on nothing but power and compulsion but that doesn't mean that's the whole story. 

事实上，这是一个相当悲惨的故事，大多数人即使说相信也并不真正相信。因为，如果你婚姻成功，你的关系真的是基于权力和剥削吗？那怎么可能行得通？首先，即使你尝试这样做，你的妻子也有她自己的手段，如果你只用权力和强制，最终会以200种不同的方式付出代价。

In fact, it's a pretty damn dismal story and most people don't believe it anyways even if they say they do because look if you're married successfully is your relationship really based on power and exploitation like how the hell's that gonna work? I mean first of all, even if you try it, you know, you have a wife and she's got her own wiles and if you try using power and compulsion and nothing else, man, you're gonna pay for it in like 200 different ways.

女性并不是特别容易被压迫的。她们非常狡猾和算计，能以300种不同的方式对付你，所以这根本行不通。如果你能做到的话，最好追求自愿的认同，这意味着你必须或多或少地成为一个体面的人。

So it's not like women are particularly easy to oppress. They're very treacherous and conniving, and they can get at you in like 300 different ways, so it just doesn't work. It's a lot better to go for something like voluntary assent, if you can manage it, which means you more or less have to be a decent person. 

你的妻子能够容忍你到什么程度，你的友谊也是如此。如果你对父权制结构持怀疑态度，但你的友谊真的基于权力，那么你只是一个带着爪牙的恶霸，他们会在找到机会的第一时间背叛你。如果你不是恶霸，你只是一个爪牙，那就更糟了。这不是建立友谊的基础。

To the degree that your wife can stand that, it's the same with your friendships. You might be cynical about the patriarchal structure, but if your friendships are really based on power, you're just a bully with his henchmen, and they'll stab you in the back the first chance they get. If you're not the bully, you're just a henchman, and that's even worse. That's no basis for friendship. 

大多数稳定且富有成效的社会层级组织同样基于自愿结合和自由选择的原则，所以这是一个更稳定的社会结构。大多数富有成效的父权层级基于能力和慷慨，而不是基于权力，这其实非常明显。

Most stable and productive social hierarchical organizations are based again on the principles of voluntary association and free choice, so that's a way more stable social structure. Most productive patriarchal hierarchies are based on both competence and generosity rather than on power, and that's actually very clear. 

当然，这并不适用于所有社会的所有时期，因为确实存在暴虐的威权国家，但这些国家往往是极其低效、短命和暴力的。它们无法在时间长河中维持自己。因此，你需要对父权制所提供的一切心怀感激，同时要足够聪明地理解其缺点，你也需要对自己采取同样的态度。

Now, that's not true in all societies at all times because you do get tyrannical authoritarian states, but they tend to be unbelievably unproductive, short-lived, and violent. They can't maintain themselves across time, so you need to be grateful to the patriarchy for everything it delivers, while still being wise enough to understand its shortcomings, and you need to do the same thing with regards to yourself.

你是否完全善良，除了被社会扭曲之外？你是否是一个贪婪的掠夺性寄生虫？在某种程度上，你确实可能倾向于那种方向，这是肯定的。你越是软弱、盲目、痛苦、怨恨、傲慢和欺骗，这种美妙的特质组合，你就会在世界上表现出这种怨恨，可能会剥削他人。但通常，在一个功能正常的社会中，人们大多数时候不是那样的，这部分原因是那样做根本行不通。

It's like, are you all good, except insofar as society has warped you? Are you a rapacious predatory parasite? To some degree, you can tilt in that direction, that's for sure, and to the degree that you're weak, blind, bitter, resentful, arrogant, deceitful, that lovely combination of traits, then you're gonna act out that resentment in the world and maybe exploit other people. But generally, in a functional society, people aren't like that most of the time, and part of the reason for that is it just doesn't work very well. 

地球上大约有百分之四的人是精神病患者，这已经很多了，但并不是95%。原因是，那种行为方式根本行不通。如果每个人都在做好自己的工作，百分之四的人可以以精神病患者的方式逃脱惩罚，这基本上就是这样。如果有足够多的人合作，使得某些生产性和慷慨的事情发生，就会为一些掠夺性寄生虫提供生存空间。百分之四，就是这样。如果这种人数开始增加，达到10%或15%，整个社会就会崩溃，连精神病患者也会死去。所以，这对他们来说也是不好的，假设他们还想活着。

About four percent of the planet's people are psychopathic, that's it. It's a lot, one in 25, but it's not 95%. The reason for that is it doesn't work very well. If everyone's doing a good job, four percent of people can get away with being psychopathic, that's basically it. If you get enough people cooperating so that you have something productive and generous happening, it opens up a space for some predatory parasites to thrive. Four percent, that's it. If they start to multiply beyond that, say up to 10 or 15 percent, the whole society collapses and even the bloody psychopaths die. So that's just not good for them, assuming they want to live.

在激进的环境运动方面发生了什么？基本上，这是一个宗教的骗局，我会说它具有那种意识形态的力量，因为它是对真正宗教愿景的替代品。你可能会说，没有所谓的真正宗教愿景，而我会说，你根本不知道你在说什么。原因是，正如我今晚试图阐述的那样，宗教活动的一部分是为你绘制地图。地图是什么？混沌与秩序。积极的混沌是积极的女性，消极的混沌是消极的女性。积极的秩序是男性，消极的秩序也是男性。

What's happening on the radical environmental front? Well, it's basically a religious shell game, I would say, and it has that force, that ideological force, because it's a replacement for a genuine religious vision. And you might say, well there's no such thing as a genuine religious vision, and I would say, well you just don't know what you're talking about. And the reason I would say that is because, and I try to lay out that argument tonight. Part of what the religious enterprise does is map out the territory for you. It's like, what's the territory? Chaos versus order. Positive chaos, that's the positive feminine. Negative chaos, that's the negative feminine. Positive order, that's the masculine. Negative order, that's the masculine.

个体走在这两者之间的微妙界线上，这就是阴阳之间的界线，是最大的意义之地。个体也有积极和消极的元素，一个完善的叙述是一个宗教故事。因此，你不可能没有这个，你绕不过去。你可能只有部分片段，但你必须有一个导向的故事。

The individual is walking the delicate line between those two, that's the line between the yin and the yang, that's the place of maximal meaning and the individual has a positive and negative element as well and a well fleshed out account of that is a religious story. And so you can't not have that, there's no way around it. You might just have a partial fragment of that, but you have to have an orienting story. 

你需要一个导向故事的部分原因是，因为没有（这样）一个（故事），你甚至无法看世界。所以我希望通过《意义的地图》做到的，就是整理这些内容，顺便说一下，那本书以及我之后写的所有东西，《超越秩序》和《人生十二法则》以及我所有的讲座和工作，都是从那本书中衍生出来的。我花了15年写那本书，试图理清这些问题，这给了我一些洞察力，知道是什么构成了意识形态和有效的信仰叙述。

And part of the reason you have to have an orienting story is because you can't even look at the world without one. So what I was hoping to do with maps of meaning, and what I'm trying to do, and that, by the way, that book like all the things I wrote after that—Beyond Order and 12 Rules for Life and all the lectures and everything I've done—it all came out of that initial book. Like I spent 15 years writing that, trying to sort all this out, and you know, it's given me some insight into what constitutes an ideology versus a valid narrative of belief. 

有效的信仰叙事具有这种全面的元素，能够将你恰当地定位在世界中。如果你知道两极，你知道自然的消极面和积极面等等，你可以在某种意义上将它们相互对立，并找到一个居住的地方。你可以聪明地看到消极的一面，但也可以充满希望地看到积极的一面。这样，你既聪明又充满希望，这是一个不错的组合，对吧？如果你聪明又充满希望，你就能正确地航行于人生。你也不会轻易陷入愚蠢的意识形态，因为你已经有了防御。你听到一个像环境故事这样的叙述，你会想，是的，这很合理，但其他角色在哪里呢？

And a valid narrative of belief has this comprehensive element and it situates you properly in the world. You know, if you know about the polarity, you know the negative element of nature and the positive, etc., you can start to play those off against each other in some sense and find a place to live. And you can be wise and see what's negative, but you can be hopeful and see what's positive. And then you're wise and hopeful, and that's a good deal. Right? If you're wise and hopeful, you can navigate through life properly. And then you'll also not fall prey to idiot ideologies, because now you're defended. You hear a story like the environmental story, and you think, yeah, yeah, fair enough, but like where are the rest of the characters? 

答案不能是“我们只是忽略它们”，因为那意味着你忽略了一半的世界。就像你对一侧视而不见，结果你会一直往左走，直到跌下悬崖。然后你会跌下悬崖，因为你使用的地图不能正确地引导你在世界中定位。那么，你知道什么呢？意识形态是寄生在宗教上层结构上的，你至少部分了解宗教下层结构是什么——它是这种对立角色的动态景观的表征，必须涵盖整个领域：自然、文化、混沌、秩序和个体。这能让你在世界中正确地定位。这是非常深刻的。

And the answer can't be, well, we just don't take them into account. Like, yeah, well, that's half the world. It's like you're blind on one side, and you're just gonna be moving leftward as it turns out in this particular case, until you fall off a cliff. And then you'll fall off a cliff because the map you're using can't orient you properly in the world. And so, well, there you go. So now what do you know? Ideologies are parasites on a religious superstructure, you know what the religious substructure is, at least in part—it's the representation of this dynamic landscape of opposing characters that have to cover the whole territory: nature, culture, chaos, order, and the individual. And that orients you properly in the world. And this is so deep.

### 混沌与秩序

你的大脑有两个半球，对吧？一个处理混沌，一个处理秩序。你会想，混沌和秩序是真实的吗？它们如此真实，以至于塑造了你大脑的进化。还能有比这更真实的东西吗？

You have two hemispheres, right? Your brain has two hemispheres. Well, one process is chaos and one process is order. And you think, well, is chaos and order real? It's like, well, it's so real it's shaped the evolution of your brain. Like, how much more real do you need? 

如果你是最佳状态的意识，你的大脑半球在平衡中运作。你一方面在有序和可预测的世界中有序地生活，另一方面在你尚未理解的可能性中寻求变革。

And so if you're optimally conscious, your hemispheres are operating in balance. And you're partly ordered in the orderly and predictable world, and you're partly oriented to what you still don't understand in the possibility of transformation. 

你的意识实际上是介于混沌和秩序之间的媒介，这就是它的工作原理。

And your consciousness is actually the agent that mediates between chaos and order, that's how it works. 

你还可以再加上一点，如果你正确地在混沌和秩序之间进行调解，并且你占据了这个动态的极化叙事环境，那么你会被一种意义感所充盈，因为意义实际上是本能，它告诉你，当你在一个正确叙述细节的世界中扮演好自己的角色时，你正在做正确的事。

And then you could even add one more thing to that, which is if you're mediating between chaos and order properly and so you're occupying this dynamic polarized narrative environment, then you're imbued with a sense of meaning because meaning is actually the instinct that tells you when you're playing your part properly in a world that's fleshed out in the proper narrative detail. 

你能找到令人着迷且有意义的东西吗？为什么？因为你在正确的时间、正确的地点做着正确的事情。你足够智慧，能理解世界的表征，以隐喻、象征和叙事的方式，并在实际中保持秩序与混沌的适当平衡。这是非常有用的，因为人们常说，生活没有意义。事实上，这是不对的。意义是最深的本能，它也是对抗痛苦的药物。

Can you find something engrossing and meaningful? Why? Because you're in the right place at the right time doing the right thing. You're wise enough to understand the characterization of the world, you have order and chaos in proper balance, metaphorically, symbolically, in a narrative manner, and also really. And that's really useful to know, you know, because people say, well, life has no meaning. It's like, no, that's just not right. Meaning is the deepest instinct and it's also useful to know, it's the medication against pain. 

每个人都认为痛苦是真实的，对吧？不管你多么愤世嫉俗，（但）你对自己的痛苦并不会愤世嫉俗。你当然相信它的存在。你甚至可能认为没有什么比痛苦更真实，这个观点是有道理的。但如果你能用有意义的东西面对痛苦，并说“这是值得的”，那么你就拥有了一种如此深刻的东西，甚至能对抗痛苦。

Everyone thinks pain is real, right? I don't care how cynical you are, you're not cynical about your own pain. You certainly believe in that. And you might even think there's no reality more fundamental than pain, and there's an argument to be made for that. But you know, if you can face pain with something meaningful and say it's worth it, then you have something that's so deep that it even works against pain. 

然后你会想，你那种平衡混沌和秩序的能力，能占据产生意义感的适当叙事领地，这种能力能使你甚至对抗痛苦，没有什么比能对抗痛苦的东西更真实的了。

And then you think, well, that ability you have to balance chaos and order, to occupy that proper narrative territory that produces the intimation of meaning and that can fortify you against even pain, there's nothing more real than what can fortify you against pain. 

所以，这就是为什么我们最根本地需要一个导向叙事，这不是可选项。没有它，你就会陷入混沌、焦虑、绝望、社会分裂、苦涩和虚无主义，这些都是可替代的，但它们不是好的替代品，除非你希望这样，那么你只是被另一种叙事所控制。没有办法逃避这一点。

And so the idea that, well, that's why we need an orienting narrative most fundamentally, it's not optional. Without it, you just collapse into chaos and anxiety and hopelessness and social divisiveness and bitterness and nihilism, all of that, that's the alternative. That's no alternative unless that's what you want, in which case you're just gripped by a different narrative. You know, there's no way out of it. 

总之，我今晚讲了我想告诉你们的，希望这有一定的道理，也希望你们现在在对抗意识形态控制方面更加强大。现在我们进入问答环节。非常感谢大家。你好啊，能在这里见到你真好。

So anyways, yeah, well, I guess I told you what I wanted to tell you tonight and hopefully that made a certain amount of sense and hopefully you're now fortified in a more robust manner against ideological possession. And with that, we'll turn to the Q&A. Thank you very much, everyone. Hello there. Fancy meeting you here.

### Q&A

#### 如果有人现在处于自杀边缘，你会对TA说什么？

**Tammy**

三年前我差点自杀，但最终没有跳下去。现在我好多了。那么，如果有人现在处于边缘，你会对TA说什么？

Isn't it? Alright, ready? I almost committed suicide three years ago, but I did not jump. I'm better now. What would you tell someone who might currently be on the edge?

**Jordan**

很难为绝望的人提供通用的建议，因为通往绝望的道路有很多条。但是我遇到过一个特别疯狂的教授，当我18岁在阿尔伯塔大学上学时遇到的。他是一个非常古怪的人。大约20年后的一天，他突然消失了，他乘坐一辆去温尼伯看望家人的公共汽车，从此再也没有出现过，也没有人找到他的任何踪迹。

Well, it's hard to come up with generic advice for someone who's desperate because there are many pathways to desperation. But I had this crazy professor that I met at the University of Alberta when I was 18, and he was quite the bizarre person. He vanished one day about 20 years later. He got on a bus in Winnipeg to go visit his family and never showed up, and they never found a trace of him. 

在阿尔伯塔大学期间，他在附近的最高安全级别监狱担任心理学家，他带我去过几次。那是一段令人毛骨悚然的经历，我在埃德蒙顿的最高安全级别监狱里遇到了一些相当严重的精神病患者。他是一个有趣的人，名叫Thauberger。他经常给我们做多项选择测试，有时所有四个答案都是一样的，我觉得这很有创意，也很有趣。

Anyways, at the University of Alberta, he worked as the psychologist at the maximum-security prison that was located nearby, and he took me out there a couple of times. So that was quite the hair-raising experience, and I met some pretty serious psychopaths in the Edmonton maximum-security prison. And he was a funny guy. This Thauberger was his name. He used to give us multiple-choice tests, did a course on creativity, and now and then he'd throw in a multiple-choice test question, and all four answers would be the same, which I thought was, I guess, that was creative, and it was certainly funny, I thought.

有些学生非常讨厌他，但我觉得他很棒。他真的很酷。他对自杀有什么看法？他说：“你总是可以明天再做。”这确实是个不错的建议。你成功后就无法再做第二次了，所以为什么不等一等呢？你能不能等一等？这是通用的建议，但确实值得思考，因为这是最后的举动。我还会说，让周围的人知道，你不要把这个秘密藏起来。如果你没有人可以倾诉，那真的该去医院告诉医生。你去医院时可以说：“我有自杀的想法，我有计划，这是我的计划。”这也是评估一个人是否有自杀倾向的方式。

Some of the students really hated him, but I thought he was great. He was really cool. And what did he say about suicide? "You can always do it tomorrow." Yeah, well, that's pretty good. It's pretty good. That's a pretty good piece of advice. It's like, you don't get to do it twice if you're successful, so is it not possible just to wait? Can you just wait? And that's pretty generic advice, but it's definitely worth thinking about because it's its final act. Then I would say to let people around know, you don't want to keep that a secret. And if you don't have anyone to tell, really it's time to go to the hospital and tell someone. And you tell when you go to the hospital you say, "I'm suicidal and I have a plan and here's my plan." And that's, by the way, how you assess someone for suicidality. 

因为抑郁的人，很多人都会抑郁，会有自杀的念头，这并不罕见。那么你可能会问自己，怎么知道一个人是否有自杀倾向？

Because depressed people, lots of people get depressed, will have suicidal thoughts, and they're far from rare. And so then you might ask yourself, well, how do you know when someone's suicidal? 

当你问，“你是否曾有过自我毁灭的想法？”然后他们说，“在我父亲的房子里有一个地下室，那里有一把手枪，它在书桌的右上角，我知道那把枪的子弹在书桌的左下抽屉里，我曾经拿出那把枪玩弄它，想着我的父母下周会离开一个周末，他们不会回来，我可以进浴室，把枪管放进嘴里结束这一切。”这就是一个有自杀倾向的人。这是因为他们不仅仅是被模糊的想法困扰，他们有一个具体可实施的死亡愿景，这非常不好。

And they're suicidal when they say to you, "Do you ever think self-destructive thoughts?" And they say, "In my father's house there's a basement, there's a pistol down there, and it's in the top right-hand corner of the bureau, and I know the bullets for that gun are in the bottom left-hand drawer, and you know, I've taken that gun out of that drawer and I've toyed with it and I thought, you know, my parents are leaving next week for a weekend and they won't be back and I could go into the bathroom and put the barrel in my mouth and end it." It's like, that's a suicidal person. And that because they're not just being plagued by vague thoughts, they have a fully detailed, implementable vision of their death, and that's not good. 

所以，如果在场的任何人有这种详细的自杀幻想，我会说，向别人倾诉，向别人倾诉，向更多的人去倾诉，向你身边最关心的那个人倾诉。如果你没有人可以倾诉，那就去医院倾诉。

And so if there's anybody in the audience who has that sort of fully fleshed out fantasy, I would say tell someone, tell someone, tell more than one person, tell the closest person you have to someone who cares, and if you don't have anybody to tell, then go to the hospital and tell them.

因为如果你有自杀倾向，概率很高的是你确实有某种问题，你在某种程度上病了，可能是抑郁，但导致抑郁的原因有很多。有时候你可能因为生活糟糕而抑郁，这是非常复杂的，但有时候你抑郁是因为你有免疫系统问题、炎症状况，或者你患有尚未诊断的疾病，或者你有季节性情感障碍，生物钟紊乱。有很多原因会让你绝望到抑郁自杀的地步，而这些问题总有可能被解决。这很棘手，因为当你抑郁时，你肯定会认为未来是暗淡的，过去是痛苦的，现在是无法忍受的，未来肯定更糟糕，而且这全都是你的错，这基本上就是抑郁的阴云。它影响一切。

Because the probability is pretty high if you're suicidal that there's actually something wrong with you, that you're ill in some manner, and maybe you're depressed, but there's a lot of reasons to be depressed. Sometimes you might be depressed because you just have a terrible life, and that's very complicated, but sometimes you're depressed because you have an immunological condition, an inflammatory condition, or you're ill in some way that hasn't been diagnosed, or you have seasonal affective disorder and your circadian rhythms are off. There's a lot of reasons that you can get desperate enough to be suicidally depressed, and there's always the possibility that that can be fixed. And it's tricky because when you're depressed you definitely think that the future is dismal, and the past is dismal, and the present is unbearable, and the future is definitely worse, and it's all your fault besides, and that's basically the depressive cloud. It affects everything.

这是一种非常底层、深刻的脑部和心理状态，但通常是可以纠正的。因为你总是可以明天再做，所以你不妨在做出最终决定之前，尝试所有的治疗方法。这是我会告诉那些处于边缘的人们的建议。还有一点，你也必须明白，如果你周围有人爱你，他们很可能永远无法真正从中恢复过来。所以你可能会认为，如果你结束了自己，你会帮到周围的人。抑郁的人通常真的相信这一点，但我有很多来访者因为家人的自杀而受到严重创伤，他们一生都在折磨自己，想着“如果……”。

It's very low-level, profound, deep, brain and psychic state, but it's generally rectifiable. Since you can always do it tomorrow, you might as well run the whole gamut of treatments before you make the final decision. So that's what I would tell people who are, oh, and the other thing too, you gotta understand too about suicide is that if there are people around you that love you, it's pretty likely that they'll never really recover. So you might be thinking that if you took yourself out, you'd be doing the people around you a favor. Often people who are depressed really believe that, but I've had lots of clients who were pretty damn traumatized by a familial suicide and they just torture themselves for the rest of their life thinking, what if? 

例如，我有一个来访者，她的亲人在她错过他们的电话后的一小时内自杀了。你怎么能从这种情况下恢复呢？因为你会一直想，如果我当时在那里……然后你没有。你无法和那个人谈论这件事，没有真正的方法来纠正这种情况，你只能带着这种内疚生活，这是非常可怕的事情。这也是为什么大多数社会将自杀视为一种犯罪，因为你会留下灾难性的后果，这也不是一件好事。所以，如果你抑郁了，你会认为对其他人来说你消失会更好，但通常事实并非如此。几乎可以肯定地说，事实并非如此。这是你在自杀分析和预防方面需要知道的一些事情。

Well, I had one client, for example, one of her relatives committed suicide an hour after she missed a phone call from them. How the hell do you recover from that? Because you just think, if I would have just been there... and then you don't. You can't talk to the person about it, there's no real way of rectifying that, you just live with that guilt and it's a pretty damn awful thing. That's why most societies regard suicide as a crime, because you leave an aftermath of catastrophic destruction in your wake, and that's also not a good thing. So, you know, if you're depressed, you're gonna think it's gonna be better for everyone else if you're just gone, but generally that's far from the truth. Almost inevitably, it's far from the truth. So those are some things you need to know on the suicide analysis and prevention front. 

#### 养育孩子的建议

**Tammy**

如果你在今天的世界里养育孩子，你会有不同的做法吗？你对今天的父母有什么建议？

If you were raising your children in today's world, would you do things differently? What advice do you have for parents today? 

**Jordan**

是的，我认为我们做得相当不错，我对我们的孩子很满意，但我认为我们没有带孩子去教堂。这是一个错误。因为，我会说，我们的家庭环境在根本上是非常宗教化的，是一个充满玩乐但也非常严肃的地方，孩子们吸收了大量的道德纪律。我们教他们如何协商，教他们为自己站起来，他们在这两方面都做得很好。

Yeah, well, I think we did pretty well and I'm pretty happy with our kids, but I think I didn't bring our kids to church. We didn't bring our kids to church, and that was a mistake. It was a mistake because, you know, I would say our familial environment was pretty religious in its orientation, fundamentally, and it was a playful place, but also a very serious place, and the kids imbibed plenty of, let's say, moral discipline. And we taught them to negotiate, and we taught them to stand up for themselves, and they got very good at both of those.

但他们没有机会学习圣经故事。我小时候去过主日学，我不太喜欢，但首先，那又怎样？在我们的城镇，当宗教开始衰落时，愤世嫉俗者常说，这些虚伪的基督徒，他们周日去教堂一小时，然后一周的其他时间里仍然是邪恶和狡诈的。是的，没错，这确实是虚伪，但你要怎么做？你要用完全不尝试做一个好人来代替吗？那是你的改进吗？你花了一小时愚蠢地、虚伪地尝试做一个好人，这确实很可悲。但这似乎比从未尝试过要好得多。

But they didn't have an opportunity to learn the biblical stories. I went to Sunday school when I was a kid. I didn't really like it, but first of all, so what? The cynics used to say in our town, this is when religion was beginning its descent, that it's undergone particularly in the last 30 years, like all these hypocritical Christians, they go to church on Sunday for an hour and then they're just as evil and conniving the rest of the week. It's like, fair enough, how hypocritical, fair enough, but what are you gonna do? You're gonna replace that with like zero time trying to be good? That's your improvement? It's like, you got that hour and you're trying stupidly and hypocritically to be good, and that's pretty pathetic. But it seems to be a lot better than not ever trying it at all.

我确实在主日学学到了很多，尽管在那段时间内坐不住，也不想再去上学。我确实深入地学习了圣经故事，这非常有用。当我在1982年左右开始教授《意义的地图》课程时，所有的学生都知道基本的圣经故事。但到2017年左右，60%的学生完全不知道这些故事。所以，教这门课几乎是不可能的，因为我必须先讲一门圣经故事课，然后才能讲宗教叙事课程。

And so I did learn in Sunday school, despite the impossibility of sitting still during that period of time, and the fact that I didn't want to go to school yet another day. I did learn the biblical stories in some depth, and that was insanely useful. One of the things I noticed when I was teaching my Maps of Meaning course, I started teaching that around 1982. Everyone I taught the course to knew the basic biblical stories. But by the time it was around 2017, 60% of the kids didn't know the stories at all. So, it was almost impossible to teach the course because I'd have to do a course in biblical stories before I could do this course about religious narrative. 

而且他们并没有用什么伟大的智慧来代替这些知识，他们只是根本不知道任何故事。因为他们的父母可能会想，“我们让孩子自己在宗教信仰的美妙世界中探索。”不，你不能。你连一种宗教都处理不好，怎么可能处理十种？这根本不可能。我认为那对我们会有好处。我们的孙女刚刚受洗，大家似乎都很高兴。

And it's not like they replaced that with any great wisdom, they just didn't know any stories. Because their parents might have thought, "Well, we'll let our kids sort their way through the whole wonderful world of religious belief." No, you won't. You can't even manage one religion, how the hell are you gonna manage ten? It's just not gonna happen. I think that would have been good for us. And our granddaughter just got baptized, and everybody seemed pretty happy about that. 

此外，我还明白现代人非常自恋，我在13岁时也确实是这样。我想，“教会有很多我不同意的地方。”但我没有被注意到，谁在乎我怎么想？因为我只是一个13岁的孩子。这为什么要关于我的想法？谁在乎我怎么想？我甚至不应该在乎我怎么想，因为我什么都不懂。

And so, I've also come to understand that modern people are pretty narcissistic, and I certainly fell into that category as a 13-year-old. I thought, "Well, there's a lot of things about the church that I don't really agree with." But I didn't notice, like, who cared what I thought? Because I was a 13-year-old kid. Why was this about what I thought? Who cared what I thought? I shouldn't have even cared what I thought, because I didn't know anything.

所以，也许你们中的一些人不愿意加入一个公民组织、政党或教会，因为你知道，它们不是腐败和虚伪的吗？是的，它们是。你也是。如果它们如此受损，而你如此智慧和美好，为什么你不去那里稍微修复一下呢？因为你可以这样做，而不是假装自己超然于这一切，因为你绝对不是。所以，我们没有处理得那么好，我想我们现在所做的事情在某种程度上是对我们罪过的赎罪。但是，我不知道，你怎么看？还有什么是我们搞砸的吗？

And so, maybe some of you are loath to join a civic organization or a political party or a church because, you know, aren't they corrupt and hypocritical? Yeah, they are. So are you. And if they're so damaged and you're so wise and wonderful, like, why don't you just go there and fix them up a bit? Because you could do that instead of just pretending that you're above all that because you're definitely not. So, we didn't handle that as well as we might have, and I suppose we're atoning for our sins to some degree by doing what we're doing now. But I don't know, what do you think? Is there anything else we screwed up? 

**Tammy**

哦，好吧，我25年前就不吃麸质了，但没有人注意到这一点。

Oh well, I gave up gluten 25 years ago and nobody paid any attention to it. 

**Peterson**

是的，你认为我们本可以做到这一点。

Yes, you think we could have done that.

**Tammy**

不过除此之外，我觉得都还好。

but other than that, I think.

**Peterson**

好吧，听到这个我很高兴。

okay, glad to hear it. 

#### 关于安德鲁·泰特和全球年轻男性中正在发生的男性运动的看法

**Tammy**

关于安德鲁·泰特和全球年轻男性中正在发生的男性运动的看法。[^3]

Opinions on Andrew Tate and the masculine movement happening in young men across the globe.

##### Peterson

我其实没怎么提到安德鲁·泰特，今晚也可能不会。但我会对安德鲁·泰特现象发表一些评论。关于安德鲁·泰特，有一个谜题，谜题是为什么他这么受欢迎？我认为他受欢迎的部分原因是因为他不轻易屈服，所谓的不弯腰。这并不明显是因为他有杰出的道德品质，因为我对他在性产业方面的所作所为并不特别感兴趣。

I really haven't said anything about Andrew Tate and I probably won't tonight. But I'll make a few comments about the Andrew Tate phenomenon. You know, there is a mystery in relationship to Andrew Tate, and the mystery is why is he so popular? I think part of the reason he's so popular is because he doesn't easily bend a knee, so to speak. And it isn't obvious to me that he doesn't bend a knee because of his stellar moral character, but because I'm not particularly impressed by what he's done on the sex business front.

在我看来，他有点像皮条客，而我并不特别崇拜皮条客，即使他们是电子版的。但我不太了解他的生活细节，除了这个比较随意的诊断之外，我不打算再说什么了。但这里确实有一个谜题，谜题是他为什么能吸引公众的想象力？很明显，他成为了一种声音，也许有点像暴力说唱歌手，对年轻人有同样的吸引力。而这种吸引力是一种替代屈辱失败的选择。所以，也许直率的攻击性是一种比屈辱失败更好的选择。我对这种观点有些同情。所以，泰特至少代表了这一点。除此之外，我对他或他的所作所为或他所代表的东西了解不够，所以我不会再评论，就到这里吧。

It seems to me a bit on the pimpy side, let's say, and I'm not a great admirer of pimps. So, even if they're the electronic version, you know, but I don't know that much about the details of his life and apart from that rather casual diagnosis, I'm gonna leave it alone. But there is a mystery there, and the mystery is why has he captured the public imagination? And it's clear that he's become a voice, maybe, you know, maybe like a kind of a violent rapper, same sort of attraction to young men. And that attraction is the attraction of what's the alternative to a kind of cringing defeat, you know? And so maybe forthright aggression is a preferable alternative to a cringing defeat. And I have some sympathy for that viewpoint, you know? So, and I think Tate at least stands for that. Apart from that, I don't know enough about him or what he's done or what he stands for to comment, so we'll leave it at that.

#### 有什么和女人说话的技巧吗

##### Tammy

有什么和女人说话的技巧吗?

Any tips on how to talk to women? 

##### Peterson

那很简单。你不要对女性说教，而是倾听她们。是的，这很有趣，但也相当真实。作为一个治疗师，你会学到一些东西，我认为这些在与女性沟通时非常有用，不仅仅是与女性，和男性也是，但我认为对男性来说，了解这一点特别重要。当你的妻子有问题时，一般她不希望你提供解决方案。即使你有解决方案，你可能会想，为什么你不直接要解决方案呢？如果我在和一个朋友谈话，他就会想要解决方案。

That's easy. You don't talk to women, you listen to them. Yeah, and that's funny, but it's also pretty true. You know, one of the things you learn as a therapist, and I think this is very useful in relation to communicating with women, and not just women, with women and men, but I think it's more true, it's particularly true in that it's very useful for men to know this. When your wife has a problem, generally she doesn't want you to provide a solution. And even if you have the solution and you might think, well, why the hell don't you just want the solution? If I was talking to one of my friends, he'd just want the solution. 

答案是因为她不知道问题是什么。这不是一种贬低的评论，就像如果有人来找你做治疗，诊断问题是难以置信的困难，因为这个人会说，我很痛苦和不开心，所以我来接受治疗。但你并不知道他们具体为什么痛苦和不开心。你不知道这是环境问题，还是身体问题，也许他们只是生病了。你不知道是他们做错了什么，还是他们的某些想法对他们没有帮助。

And the answer is because she doesn't know what the problem is. And so, and this is very, and that's not a denigrating comment, it's like if someone comes to see you as a therapist, the diagnosis of the problem is incredibly difficult because the person comes in and they say, you know, I'm miserable and unhappy and that's why I'm here in therapy, let's say. But then you don't know exactly why they're miserable and unhappy. You don't know if it's situational, you don't know if it's physical, maybe they're just ill. You don't know if it's something that they're doing wrong or something that they're thinking that isn't helpful to them. 

你完全不知道他们为什么抑郁和痛苦。他们可能有一些想法，但这并不意味着他们是对的。所以你要做的很大一部分工作就是让这个人说话。弗洛伊德通过他的所谓自由联想技术发现了这一点，他会让他的来访者随便说出脑海中的任何想法。

Or you just have no idea why they're depressed and miserable. And they might have some ideas, but that doesn't mean that they're right, either. And so a huge part of what you do is you just let the person talk. And Freud discovered this with his so-called free association technique, you know, he would just let his clients, and what he would tell them is like just say whatever comes into your mind. 

弗洛伊德注意到，如果你让人们这样做，他们会围绕那些让他们情感困扰的话题进行一种漫游，有些是现在的，有些是过去的。这些最终会凝聚成某种连贯和压缩的叙述。部分治疗的作用就是让这种事情发生。所以，当你和女性交谈时，你做的很多事情就是倾听。你倾听的原因是要弄清楚问题到底是什么。实际上，我认为女性的负面情绪平均比男性高。

And what Freud noticed was that if you let people do that, they would take a kind of a wandering trip around the topics that were of emotional distress to them, some of them present and some of them past. And that that would eventually coalesce into something like a coherent and compressed narrative. And that partly what you were doing in therapy was just letting that happen. And so a lot of what you're doing when you're talking to women is just listening. And the reason you're listening is to find out what the hell the problem is. And it's actually the case that, and I think women are higher in negative emotion than men on average. 

这有多种原因。女性体型较小，上半身力量不如男性，因此不如男性在身体对抗中有优势。因此，女性在负面情绪，如焦虑方面稍微高一些，平均而言，世界对女性来说更危险，我认为这在身体和性方面都是如此。但负面情绪的增加从青春期开始，因为男孩和女孩在负面情绪上没有差别，但青少年有，而这种差别一旦形成就会是永久的。

And I think there's a variety of reasons for that. And they're smaller, and so and they're not as powerful in their upper body, and so they're not as armed to engage in physical combat. And so the fact that there's somewhat more higher negative emotion, anxiety for example, signals the fact that on average the world is a more dangerous place for women, which I think is true both physically and sexually. But they're also higher in negative emotion, it kicks in at puberty, that's when women become sexually vulnerable, because boys and girls don't differ in negative emotion, but adolescents do, and that's permanent, once that is instantiated. 

此外，女性是孩子的调解者，负面情绪较高的部分原因是她们对威胁更敏感，她们需要这样，因为孩子更脆弱。女性对威胁更敏感，因为她们需要照顾孩子。如果你觉得这没有道理，那是因为你没有认真思考。这也意味着女性在发现男性可能还没注意到的威胁方面很在行。这种敏感的缺点是，她们可能会发现并不存在的威胁。

But also, you know, women are the mediators for children, and part of the reason they have higher levels of negative emotion is because they're more threat-sensitive, and they need to be because children are more vulnerable. And so women are more threat-sensitive because they have to take care of children. Now, if that doesn't make sense to you, you're just not thinking. And so, what that also implies is that women are pretty good at detecting threats that men may yet not notice. Now, the downside of that is they might detect threats that aren't there.

这就是缺点，对吧?因为如果你是一个更敏感的仪器，就会有更多的假阳性。警报会在没有危险时响起。但优点是，如果女性特别擅长发现威胁，她们会在你注意到之前告诉你什么不对劲。这也是非常有用的。

Well, that is the downside, right? Because if you're a more sensitive instrument, there's going to be more false positives. The alarm is going to go off when there's no danger. But the upside is that women are pretty good at detecting, if they're particularly good at detecting threats, they're going to be able to tell you what's not right before you would notice. And that can be real useful too.

但这并不意味着她们知道问题是什么。她们可能会对某事感到不安，也许有50种关于问题可能是什么的想法，但她们不知道。你应该做的是坐在那里闭嘴听，或许问一些问题，看看能不能弄清问题是什么。你会发现，当你和人打交道时，尤其是在治疗中，你会经常发现这一点：如果你让人们把问题说出来，这可能需要很长时间。有时真的需要很长时间，有时可能需要数百个小时。但你会和你的妻子在一起数百个小时，对吧？如果你不自愿地听她说，你就会被迫听她说。

But that doesn't mean they know what it is. They're going to be upset about something and maybe they have 50 ideas about what that might be but they don't know. What you're supposed to do is just sit there and shut up and listen, maybe ask some questions to see if you can figure out what the problem is. One of the things you'll find when dealing with people, you find this in therapy all the time, is if you let people lay out the problem, and that can take a long time. It can really take a long time, sometimes hundreds of hours. But you're going to be with your wife for hundreds of hours, you know? And if you don't listen to her voluntarily, you're going to listen to her involuntarily.

如果你让她在这个过程中自由漫步，她会自己消除90%的担忧，因为她会把问题说出来，然后想到，“哦，这可能不值得担心。”但在她说出来之前，她并不知道这一点。所以这对男性来说是一个好东西；你可以闭嘴听着，问一些真正的问题。你不想把这当成游戏。

If you let her wander through the territory, she'll get rid of 90% of the concerns by herself because she'll lay them out and she'll think, "Oh, that's probably not worth worrying about," but she doesn't know that before she lays it out. So it's a good thing for men to know; you can just shut up and listen and ask a few questions, you know, that are real questions. You don't want to play this like it's a game. 

这是每个人都应该知道的一种有效沟通策略，因为这非常有用：如果你听别人陈述一系列问题，除了提问之外，你可以做的一件事是说，“这是我目前所理解的你的意思……”你不会逐字逐句重复他们说的话，而是会将其压缩和总结，这有助于他们抓住问题的要点。如果你问对方，“这是我理解的你的意思。是这样吗？”

And one effective communication strategy that everyone should know, because this is extremely useful, is if you listen to someone laying out a set of problems, one thing you can do, apart from asking a question, is to say, "Here's what I think you've said so far," you know? And you're not going to repeat verbatim what they said; you're going to condense and compress it, and that helps them get at the gist of the problem. And if you ask the person, "Here's what I think you said. Is this what you meant?" 

如果他们说是，那么恭喜你，这是一个很大的胜利，因为他们会因为你倾听而感到高兴。如果他们说不是，那么你可以继续倾听，他们可以从不同的角度继续阐述，直到你抓住问题的核心。通常你会发现，问题的核心要比所有问题的全貌简单得多。但这需要相当的耐心。

And if they say yes, well, hooray, home run for you, and they're happy because you listened. And if they say no, well, then maybe you can listen some more and they can take it from a different tack till you get at the heart of the matter. And generally what you'll find is the heart of the matter is a lot simpler than the entire panoply of problems being spread out. But it requires a fair bit of patience. 

还有，这里也存在一种傲慢和粗心，即男性倾向于跳进去解决问题，因为你太容易把自己表现成那个有答案的人。而她并不真的想要那个有答案的人，她想要那个有问题的人。

And also, see, there's an arrogance also in that, an arrogance and a carelessness in that male proclivity to jump in and solve the problem because you can easily, too easily, present yourself as the guy with the answers, you know? And she doesn't really want the guy with the answers right then and there; she wants the guy with the questions. 

但这也会减轻你的负担，确实应该减轻，因为这并不完全由你来立即解决问题，尤其是因为这可能是她的问题，也许她需要自己解决，对吧？因为你实际上不想解决别人的问题；你要把问题留给他们，因为那是他们的生活。你不应该为任何人做他们自己可以做的事情。这就像照顾老人的第一条规则：不要为他们做他们还能做的事情，因为那样只会剥夺他们的自主权、责任感和尊严。同样，对孩子也是如此；即使你可能会到诱惑，也不要为他们做他们自己能做的事情。你也不应该为你的妻子或丈夫这样做。别插手他们的生活。你知道什么呢？说真的，你可以倾听，可以帮助对方澄清他们想要前进的道路，但贸然跳进去解决问题，说“我有答案给你”其实是非常傲慢的。

But it also takes a certain load off you, it should, because it's not exactly up to you to instantaneously solve the problem, especially because it might be her problem, and maybe she needs to solve it, right? Because you actually don't want to solve a problem that's someone else's problem; you want to leave it with them because that's their life. You don't want to do anything for anybody that they can do themselves. It's like the first rule for caring for old people: don't do anything for them that they can still do because you just take away their autonomy and responsibility and dignity. And it's the same with kids; you don't do things for your kids that they can do, even though you might be tempted to. And you don't do that for your wife or your husband as well. Stay the hell out of their lives. What the hell do you know? You know, seriously, man, you can listen and you can help the person learn to clarify the path they want to take forward, but it can be real arrogant to just jump in and solve the problem, saying, "I've got the answer for you."

也许你真的有答案，但你作为一个治疗师学到的一件事是，即使你有答案并告诉对方，首先，你剥夺了他们自己找到答案的机会。其次，他们不会听你的，因为他们没有做出生成那个答案所需的努力，所以他们没有实施它的任何细节。这样做根本没有帮助。精神分析师们一个世纪前就发现了这一点；他们说，如果你给人们建议，你只会得到抵抗。因为你可能会认为去看治疗师是为了得到建议，但其实不是。你去看治疗师是为了有一个人能倾听你思考你的问题。

You know, maybe you do, but one of the things you also learn as a therapist is that even if you do have the answer and you give it to the person, well, first of all, you've robbed them of the opportunity to come up with the answer for themselves. And second, they're not gonna listen to you anyways because they haven't done the work necessary to have generated that answer, and so they don't have any of the details that make it possible to implement it. It's just not helpful. The psychoanalysts figured this out like a century ago; they said if you give people advice, you just get resistance. So, you know, because you might think you go to a therapist for advice, it's like, no, you don't. You go to a therapist so that you can have someone to listen to you think through your problems.

或许对方可以提出一些有见地的问题，帮助你澄清问题，但从根本上说，一个好的治疗师是帮助你找到自己的道路。同样，如果你理解这一点，比如对于你的妻子，这会变得更有趣。我们当然关心，但这会变得更加有趣，因为首先，你可以稍微摆脱过度的责任感。然后你可以想，好吧，我可以看看这个人如何校准自己的命运。你爱上了这个人，你可能会想看看他们能成为什么样子。如果你倾听他们的心声，那么你可以促进这一过程。你不知道会发生什么，这非常有趣。

And maybe the person can ask intelligent questions and help you clarify, but fundamentally, a good therapist is there to help you find your path. And that's actually the other thing that's, you'll find too, is if you understand that, let's say about your wife, it gets way more interesting. We care, definitely, you know? And it gets way more interesting, hey, because first of all, you can detach yourself a bit from the excess responsibility. But then you can think, well, look, I get to watch this person sort of calibrate their own destiny here, you know? And who knows, you fell in love with the person; you might want to see what they could become. And if you listen to them unfold, then you can facilitate that. You don't know what's going to happen; it's extremely interesting. 

所以，我还会说，如果你觉得你的伴侣告诉你的事情很无聊，那是因为你没有认真听。这是任何社交交流的一个基本法则。如果你觉得你周围都是无聊的人，那很可能是你自己无聊。认为别人无聊几乎百分之百是因为你不能倾听。然后你会把人们简化成你对他们的刻板印象，难怪你会觉得无聊。如果你倾听人们，不管他们是谁，他们会变得非常有趣，你几乎无法忍受不听他们说话。

And so I would also say, if you're bored by what your partner is telling you, you are not listening hard enough. And that's a good rule of thumb for any social discourse at all. If you're talking, you might think I'm surrounded by boring people. It's like, no, no, you're the boring person for sure if that's the way you feel about people. The probability that that's because you can't listen is virtually a hundred percent. And then you're reducing people to your stereotype of them, and no wonder you're bored by that. If you listen to people, I don't care who they are, if you listen to people, they get so interesting, you can hardly stand being around them.

这也是为什么人们往往不倾听，因为这真的令人震惊；如果你倾听，人们是如此独特和奇怪。还有一点，如果你倾听，人们会告诉你一切，因为人们需要通过说话来理清思路。所以，如果你倾听，他们会告诉你。你可能会想，请别再告诉我这些了，但这真的非常有趣。

And so that's often why people don't listen, because it's really shocking; people are so peculiar and strange if you listen to them. And the other thing, here's something to know too: if you listen to people, they will tell you everything, because people need to talk to sort themselves out. And so if you listen, they'll tell you. It's like, please stop telling me things, but it's ridiculously interesting.

这也是你在与伴侣交流时可以学到的另一个方面。如果你能够稍微抽离，不承担过多的责任，不过于自恋于控制和拥有所有答案——这对双方都适用——那么你可以看着他们与自己的命运抗争，与你的孩子也是一样。这非常有趣，对他们也非常有好处，并且能保持你们的关系充满活力。

And so if that's another thing you can learn in relationship to communication with your partner, you know, if you can detach yourself a bit and not take on excess responsibility and not to be too narcissistic about control and having all the answers, and this can work both ways, then you can watch them struggle with their destiny, and the same with your kids. And that's ridiculously interesting, and it's really good for them too, and that keeps your relationship alive.

另一个关于沟通的好经验法则是，如果你倾听别人，你就能看到他们展开他们的命运。这会让他们变得非常有趣；因为这样，你周围都是有趣的人。你还可以看到如何在这种共同的冒险中将你的生活融合在一起，这非常好。你必须保持在自己的领域内才能做到这一点。

Another rule of thumb that's good to know in terms of communication is that if you listen to people, you get to see them unfold their destiny. And that makes them very interesting; you're surrounded by people who are interesting as a consequence of that. You can also see how you can meld your lives together in this sort of mutual search for adventure, which is very good. And you have to stay in your own ballpark to do that.

我在治疗中很喜欢这样做，因为这种抽离也让倾听变得不那么费力。你没有承担过多的责任，所以你不必觉得这是一个非常难以解决的问题，尤其是如果你是一个负责任的人。因为你可能会觉得自己需要立即承担起对方问题的责任。但如果你能抽离自己去倾听，那么压力会小得多。而且这样对方就有机会展开他们的命运，这会使你的关系保持有趣。这会帮助你保持关系，因为事情是这样的：

I really like doing that in therapy because the detachment also made it much less effortful to listen. You're not taking on that excess responsibility, so you don't have to feel this is a very hard thing to get right, especially if you're a responsible person. Because you might want to think that you need to take on the responsibility of the person's problems right away. But if you can detach yourself and listen, then it's much less stressful. And then the person gets a chance to let their destiny unfold, and then that will keep your relationship interesting. That'll help you stay, you know, because here's what it was:

当你爱上一个人时，部分原因是你看到了他们如果成为他们全部潜力会是什么样子，反之亦然。这就像是上帝的恩赐。你得以看到那个人如果展现出他们的光芒会是什么样子。你得以窥见这一点，然后这只是一瞥，然后你们俩都需要努力让它成为现实。但它可以成为现实，爱指引了方向。即使作为一个怀疑论者你也可以这样想。如果爱是一种深刻的生物本能，为什么它不会指向最大化你伴侣的生产效用呢？我的意思是，它还能指向其他方向吗，对吧？所以，爱是你与某人之间的一部分纽带，呼唤出他们最好的一面。当然，这将为培育茁壮成长的孩子提供最理想的环境。

When you fall in love with someone, you fall in love with them in part because you get a glimpse of what they could be if they were all they could be, and vice versa. It's like a gift from God. You get to see what that person would be if they let their light shine. You get a glimpse into that, you know? And then it's just a glimpse, and then you have to work, both of you, to make that a reality. But it can be a reality, and love points the way to that. And you can think about that as a skeptic even. If love is a profound biological instinct, why wouldn't it be oriented towards maximizing the productive utility of your partner? I mean, how could it be oriented otherwise, right? So, love would be part of that bond that you have with someone that calls the best out of them. And of course, that's going to prepare the ground most optimally for having children that thrive.

如果你知道爱呼唤你的是对那个人潜力的愿景，反之亦然，那么你可以稍微抽离自己，让这一切展开。这会变得非常有趣，因为当你看到这种情况发生时，你会看到你爱上的那个人的出现，这会让你再次爱上他们。为什么这不是最好的事情呢？我喜欢做治疗的原因之一是这个过程总在展开。来看我的人，他们试图向上努力，而我试图促进这一过程。即使他们处于困境中，这是通常情况，至少方向是好的。看着人们展开真是令人惊叹。

So if you know that what calls you to love is a vision of that person's potential and vice versa, then you can detach yourself a little bit and let that unfold. Then that becomes ridiculously interesting because as you see that happening, what you'll see is the emergence of the person that you fell in love with, and that makes you fall in love with them again. So why wouldn't that be the best thing that can possibly happen? One of the things I loved about doing therapy was that this process was always unfolding. The people who were coming to see me, they were trying to aim up, and I was trying to facilitate that. Even if they were in a dire state, which was often the case, at least the trajectory was good. It was amazing to watch people unfold.

我有一个来访者，当她第一次来找我时，她非常害怕，社交焦虑很严重。她一生中没有人真正关注过她，如果有人关注，那也是为了惩罚她，真的很残忍。我想和她一起喝咖啡作为一种练习，因为她无法在餐厅里与任何人交谈。我想，我们在办公室里谈话，不如去餐厅喝杯咖啡。她说绝对不行。她花了三年时间才敢这么做。但我和她一起工作了大约七年，到她结束时，她在观众面前做单口喜剧，朗诵自己的诗歌。看着一个人从那里走到这里真的是很有趣的过程。

I had one client who was so afraid when she first came to see me, so socially anxious. No one had ever paid attention to her whole life, and if they did, it was just to punish her, like it was really brutal. I wanted to go have coffee with her as an exercise because she couldn't sit in a restaurant and talk to anybody. And I thought, well, you know, we sit in the office here and talk, let's go sit in a restaurant and have a coffee. No way. It took her like three years before she could do that. But I worked with her for about seven years, and by the time she was done, she was doing stand-up comedy and reciting her own poetry in front of audiences. It's like that's pretty fun to watch someone go from the point that where there is really fun, you know?

在她的治疗过程中，整个会话几乎都是她在说话。在前四五年里，我可能在会话结束时说了几分钟的话。她有那么多话要说，因为从来没有人听她说话。数百小时从未发生的对话。然后，到了六七年后，她会先倾诉15分钟，然后我们再进行讨论。但我认为花了六年时间，我们才达到类似对话的状态，因为她需要处理大约一万个小时的未听过的对话，才能让她的思维变得相对清晰。所以，如果你和这样的人结婚，你可能需要倾听一万个小时，但这可能对你有好处。好吧，非常感谢大家。很高兴和你们交谈。谢谢你，Tammy。感谢大家的时间和关注。很高兴见到你们。再见。谢谢。

And with her, the whole session, she just talked. And for the first four or five years, I probably got to say a few things to her for five minutes at the end of the session. She had that much to say because no one ever listened to her. Hundreds of hours of conversation that never happened. And then, you know, by six or seven years into the process, she would unload for 15 minutes, and then we would have a discussion. But it took six years, I think, before we got to the point where there was anything like a dialogue because she had like 10,000 hours of unheard conversation to have just to get her brain reasonably straightened out. And so if you married someone like that, 10,000 hours of listening to do, but maybe it'll be good for you. All right, thank you very much. Good to talk to you all. Thank you, Tammy. Appreciate your time and attention, everybody. Good to see you all. All right. Thank you. Thank you.
